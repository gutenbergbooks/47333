<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">He</span>
was born blind, and had
been taught the one thing
which the blind generally
learn,&mdash;music; for this
art he was specially gifted.
His mother died
when he was little more
than a child, and his
father, who was the first
cornetist of a military
band, followed her to the
grave a few years later.
He had a brother in America from whom he
had never heard; still, through indirect sources
he knew him to be well off, married, and the
father of two fine children. To the day of his
death the old musician, indignant at his son's
ingratitude, would not allow his name to be mentioned
in his presence; but the blind boy's affection
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
for his brother remained unchanged. He
could not forget that this elder brother had been
the support of his childhood, the defence of his
weakness against the other boys, and that he had
always spoken to him with kindness. The recollection
of Santiago's voice as he entered his room
in the morning, shouting, "Hey there, Juanito!
get up, man; don't sleep so!" rang in the blind
boy's ears with a more pleasing harmony than
could ever be drawn from the keys of a piano or
the strings of a violin. Was it probable that such
a kind heart had grown cold? Juan could not
believe it, and was always striving to justify him.
At times the fault was with the mail, or it might
be that his brother did not wish to write until
he could send them a good deal of money; then
again, he fancied that he meant to surprise them
by presenting himself some fine day, laden with
gold, in the modest <i>entresol</i> in which they lived.
But he never dared communicate any of these
fancies to his father; only when the old man,
wrought to an unusual pitch of exasperation,
bitterly apostrophized the absent one, he found
the courage to say: "You must not despair,
father. Santiago is good, and my heart tells me
that we shall hear from him one of these days."</p>

<p>The father died, however, without hearing
from his son, between a priest, who exhorted
him, and the blind boy, who clung convulsively
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
to his hand, as if he meant to detain him in this
world by main force. When the old man's
body was removed from the house, the boy
seemed to have lost his reason, and in a frenzy
of grief he struggled with the undertaker's men.
Then he was left alone. And what loneliness
was his! No father, no mother, no relatives,
no friends; he was even deprived of the sunlight,
which is the friend of all created things.
He was two whole days in his room pacing the
floor like a caged wolf, without tasting food.
The chamber-maid, assisted by a compassionate
neighbor, succeeded in saving him from this
slow process of suicide. He was prevailed upon
to eat. He spent the rest of his life praying,
and working at his music.</p>

<p>His father, shortly before his death, had obtained
for him a position as organist in one of
the churches of Madrid, with a salary of seventy
cents a day. This was scarcely sufficient to
meet the running expenses of a house, however
modest; so within a fortnight Juan sold
all that had constituted the furniture of his
humble home, dismissed his servant, and took
a room at a boarding-house, for which he paid
forty cents a day; the remaining thirty cents
covered all his other expenses. He lived thus
for several months without leaving his room except
to fulfil his obligations. His only walks
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
were from the house to the church, and from
the church back again. His grief weighed upon
him so heavily that he never opened his lips.
He spent the long hours of the day composing
a grand requiem Mass for the repose of his
father's soul, depending upon the charity of the
parish for its execution; and although it would
be incorrect to say that he strained his five
senses,&mdash;on account of his having but four,&mdash;it
can at least be said that he threw all the
energies of his body and soul into his work.</p>

<p>The ministerial crisis overtook him before his
task was half finished. I do not remember who
came into power, whether the Radicals, Conservatives,
or Constitutionals; at any rate, there
was some great change. The news reached Juan
late, and to his sorrow. The new cabinet soon
judged him, in his capacity as an organist, to be
a dangerous citizen, and felt that from the heights
of the choir, at vespers or in the solemnity of the
Mass, with the swell and the roar from all the
stops of the organ, he was evincing sentiments
of opposition which were truly scandalous. The
new ministers were ill disposed, as they declared
in Congress through the lips of one of their authorized
members, "to tolerate any form of imposition,"
so they proceeded with praiseworthy
energy to place Juan on the retired list, and to
find him a substitute whose musical man&oelig;uvres
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
might offer a better guarantee,&mdash;a man, in a
word, who would prove more loyal to the institutions.
On being officially informed of this,
the blind one experienced no emotion beyond
surprise. In the deep recesses of his heart he
was pleased, as he was thus left more time in
which to work at his Mass. The situation appeared
to him in its real light only when his
landlady, at the end of the month, came to him
for money. He had none to give her, naturally,
as his salary had been withdrawn; and he was
compelled to pawn his father's watch, after which
he resumed his work with perfect serenity and
without a thought of the future. But the landlady
came again for money at the end of another
month, and he once more pawned a
jewel of the scant paternal legacy; this was a
small diamond ring. In a few months there
was nothing left to pawn. So the landlady, in
consideration of his helplessness, kept him two
or three days beyond the time and then turned
him out, with the self-congratulatory feeling of
having acted generously in not claiming his
trunk and clothes, from which she might have
realized the few cents that he still owed her.</p>

<p>He looked for another lodging, but was unable
to rent a piano, which was a sore trial to him;
evidently he could not finish his Mass. He
knew a shopkeeper who owned a piano and who
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
permitted him to make use of it. But Juan
soon noticed that his visits grew more and more
inopportune, so he left off going. Shortly, too,
he was turned out of his new lodgings, only
this time they kept his trunk. Then came a
period of misery and anguish,&mdash;of that misery
of which it is hard to conceive. We know that
life has few joys for the homeless and the poor,
but if in addition they be blind and alone, surely
they have found the limit of human suffering.
Juan was tossed about from lodging to lodging,
lying in bed while his only shirt was being washed,
wandering through the streets of Madrid with torn
shoes, his trousers worn to a fringe about his feet,
his hair long, and his beard unshaven. Some
compassionate fellow-lodger obtained a position
for him in a café, from which, however, he was
soon turned out, for its frequenters did not relish
his music. He never played popular dances or
<span class="replace" id="tn_2" title="In the printed book: petenéras">peteneras</span>,
no fandangos, not even an occasional
polka. His fingers glided over the keys in
dreamy ecstasies of Beethoven and Chopin, and
the audience found some difficulty in keeping
time with their spoons. So out he went again
through the byways of the capital. Every now
and then some charitable soul, accidentally
brought in contact with his misery, assisted him
indirectly, for Juan shuddered at the thought of
begging. He took his meals in some tavern or
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
other in the lowest quarter of Madrid, ate just
enough to keep from starving, and for two cents
he was allowed to sleep in a hovel between beggars
and evil-doers. Once they stole his trousers
while he was asleep, and left him a pair of cotton
ones in their stead. This was in November.</p>

<p>Poor Juan, who had always cherished the
thought of his brother's return, now in the
depths of his misery nursed his chimera with redoubled
faith. He had a letter written and sent
to Havana. As he had no idea how his brother
could be reached, the letter bore no direction.
He made all manner of inquiries, but to no effect,
and he spent long hours on his knees, hoping
that Heaven might send Santiago to his rescue.
His only happy moments were those spent in
prayer, as he knelt behind a pillar in the far-off
corner of some solitary church, breathing the
acrid odors of dampness and melting wax, listening
to the flickering sputter of the tapers and
the faint murmur rising from the lips of the
faithful in the nave of the temple. His innocent
soul then soared above the cruelties of
life and communed with God and the Holy
Mother. From his early childhood devotion
to the Virgin had been deeply rooted in his
heart. As he had never known his mother,
he instinctively turned to the mother of God
for that tender and loving protection which
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
only a woman can give a child. He had composed
a number of hymns and canticles in her
honor, and he never fell asleep without pressing
his lips to the image of the Carmen, which
he wore on his neck.</p>

<p>There came a day, however, when heaven
and earth forsook him. Driven from his last
shelter, without a crust to save him from starvation,
or a cloak to protect him from the cold,
he realized with terror that the time had come
when he would have to beg. A great struggle
took place in his soul. Shame and suffering
made a desperate stand against necessity. The
profound darkness which surrounded him increased
the anguish of the strife; but hunger
conquered in the end. He prayed for strength
with sobs, and resigned himself to his fate.
Still, wishing to disguise his humiliation, he determined
to sing in the streets, at night only.
His voice was good, and he had a rare knowledge
of the art of singing. It occurred to him
that he had no means of accompaniment. But
he soon found another unfortunate, perhaps a
trifle less wretched than himself, who lent him an
old and broken guitar. He mended it as best he
could, and with a voice hoarse with tears he went
out into the street on a frosty December night.
His heart beat violently; his knees trembled under
him. When he tried to sing in one of the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
central thoroughfares, he found he could not utter
a sound. Suffering and shame seemed to have
tied a knot in his throat. He groped about until
he had found a wall to lean against. There
he stood for awhile, and when he felt a little
calmer he began the tenor's aria from the first
act of "Favorita." A blind singer who sang
neither couplets nor popular songs soon excited
some curiosity among the passers-by, and in a
few minutes a crowd had gathered around him.
There was a murmur of surprise and admiration
at the art with which he overcame the difficulties
of the composition, and many a copper was
dropped in the hat that dangled from his arm.
After this he sang the aria of the fourth act of
"Africana." But too many had stopped to listen,
and the authorities began to fear that this
might be a cause of disturbance; for it is a well-established
fact with officials of the police force
that people who congregate in the streets to hear a
blind man sing are always prompted by motives
of rebellion,&mdash;it means a peculiar hostility to
the institutions; in a word, an attitude thoroughly
incompatible with the peace of society
and the security of the State. Accordingly, a
policeman caught Juan energetically by the arm
and said, "Here, here! go straight home now,
and don't let me catch you stopping at any
more street corners."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'm doing no harm!"</p>

<p>"You are blocking the thoroughfare. Come,
move on, move on, if you don't want to go to
the lock-up."</p>

<p>It is really encouraging to see how careful
our authorities are in clearing the streets of blind
singers; and I really believe, in spite of all that
has been said to the contrary, that if they could
keep them equally free from thieves and murderers,
they would do so with pleasure. Juan
went back to his hovel with a heavy heart, for
he was by nature shrinking and timid, and was
grieved at having disturbed the peace and given
rise to the interference of the executive power.
He had made twenty-seven cents. With this
he bought something to eat on the following
day, and paid rent for the little pile of straw on
which he slept. The next night he went out
again and sang a few more operatic arias; but
the people again crowded around him, and once
more a policeman felt himself called upon to interfere,
shouting at him to move on. But how
could he? If he kept moving on, he would not
make a cent. He could not expect the people
to follow him. Juan moved on, however, on
and on, because he was timid, and the mere
thought of infringing the laws, of disturbing
even momentarily the peace of his native land,
was worse than death to him. So his earnings
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
rapidly decreased. The necessity of moving on,
on the one hand, and the fact that his performances
had lost the charm of novelty, which in
Spain always commands its price, daily deprived
him of a few coppers. With what he
brought home at night he could scarcely buy
enough food to keep him alive. The situation
was desperate. The poor boy saw but one
luminous point in the clouded horizon of his
life, and that was his brother's return to Madrid.
Every night as he left his hovel with his guitar
swinging from his shoulder he thought, "If
Santiago should be in Madrid and hear me sing,
he would know me by my voice." And this
hope, or rather this chimera, alone gave him
the strength to endure life. However, there
came again a day in which his anguish knew
no limit. On the preceding night he had
earned only six coppers. It had been so cold!
This was Christmas Eve. When the morning
dawned upon the world, it found Madrid
wrapped in a sheet of snow six inches thick.
It snowed steadily all day long, which was a
matter of little consequence to the majority of
people, and was even a cause of much rejoicing
among æsthetes generally. Those poets in particular
who enjoy what is called easy circumstances
spent the greater part of the day watching
the flakes through the plate-glass of their study
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
windows, meditating upon and elaborating those
graceful and ingenious similes that cause the
audiences at the theatre to shout, "Bravo,
bravo!" or those who read their verses to exclaim,
"What a genius that young fellow is!"</p>

<p>Juan's breakfast had been a crust of stale
bread and a cup of watery coffee. He could
not divert his hunger by contemplating the
beauty of the snow,&mdash;in the first place, because
he was blind, and in the second, because, even
had he not been blind, he would have had some
difficulty in seeing it through the patched and
filthy panes of his hovel. He spent the day
huddled in a corner on his straw mattress, evoking
scenes of his childhood and caressing the
sweet dream of his brother's return. At nightfall
he grew very faint, but necessity drove him
into the streets to beg. His guitar was gone.
He had sold it for sixty cents on a day of similar
hardship. The snow fell with the same persistence.
His legs trembled as they had when
he sang for the first time, but now it was from
hunger rather than shame. He groped about as
best he could, with great lumps of mud above
his ankles. The silence told him that there was
scarcely a soul on the street. The carriages
rolled noiselessly along, and he once came near
being run over. In one of the central thoroughfares
he began to sing the first thing
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
that came to his lips. His voice was weak and
hoarse. Nobody stopped to listen. "Let us
try another street," thought he; and he went
down the Avenue of
<span class="replace" id="tn_3" title="In the printed book: San Jeronimo">San Jerónimo</span>,
walking awkwardly
in the snow, with a white coating on his
shoulders and water squirting from his shoes.
The cold had begun to penetrate into his very
bones, and hunger gave him a violent pain. For
a moment with the cold and the pain came a
feeling of faintness which made him think that
he was about to die, and lifting his spirit to the
Virgin of the Carmen, his protectress, he exclaimed
in his anguish, "Mother, have pity!"
And after pronouncing these words he felt relieved
and walked, or rather dragged himself, to
the Plaza de las Cortes. There he grasped a
lamp-post, and under the impression of the Virgin's
protection sang Gounod's "Ave Maria."
Still nobody stopped to hear him. The people
of Madrid were at the theatres, at the cafés, or
at home, dancing their little ones on their knees
in the glow of the hearth,&mdash;in the warmth of
their love. The snow continued to fall steadily,
copiously, with the evident purpose of furnishing
a topic for the local column of the morning
paper, where it would be described in a thousand
delicate phrases. The occasional passers-by
hurried along muffled up to their ears under
their umbrellas. The lamp-posts had put on
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
their white night-caps, from under which escaped
thin rays of dismal light. The silence
was broken only by the vague and distant rumble
of carriages and by the light fall of the snowflakes,
that sounded like the faint and continuous
rustle of silk. The voice of Juan alone vibrated
in the stillness of the night, imploring the
mother of the unprotected; and his chant seemed
a cry of anguish rather than a hymn of praise, a
moan of sadness and resignation falling dreary
and chill, like snow upon the heart.</p>

<p>And his cry for pity was in vain. In vain he
repeated the sweet name of Mary, adjusting it
to the modulations of every melody. Heaven
and the Virgin were far away, it seemed, and
could not hear him. The neighbors of the
plaza were near at hand, but they did not choose
to hear. Nobody came down to take him in
from the cold; no window was thrown open to
drop him a copper. The passers-by, pursued, as
it were, by the fleet steps of pneumonia, scarcely
dared stop. Juan's voice at last died in his
throat; he could sing no more. His legs trembled
under him; his hands lost their sense of
touch. He took a few steps, then sank on the
sidewalk at the foot of the grating that surrounds
the square. He sat with his elbows on his
knees and buried his head in his hands. He
felt vaguely that it was the last moment of his
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
life, and he again prayed, imploring the divine
pity.</p>

<p>At the end of a few minutes he was conscious
of being shaken by the arm, and knew that a
man was standing before him. He raised his
head, and taking for granted it was the old story
about moving on, inquired timidly,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Are you an officer?"</p>

<p>"No; I am no officer. What is the matter
with you? Get up."</p>

<p>"I don't believe I can, sir."</p>

<p>"Are you very cold?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; but it isn't exactly that,&mdash;I haven't
had anything to eat to-day."</p>

<p>"I will help you, then. Come; up with you."</p>

<p>The man took Juan by both arms and stood
him on his feet. He seemed very strong.</p>

<p>"Now lean on me, and let us see if we can
find a cab."</p>

<p>"But where are you going to take me?"</p>

<p>"Nowhere where you wouldn't want to go.
Are you afraid?"</p>

<p>"No; I feel in my heart that you will help
me."</p>

<p>"Come along, then. Let's see how soon I
can get you something hot to drink."</p>

<p>"God will reward you for this, sir; the Virgin
will reward you. I thought I was going to
die there, against that grating."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>

<p>"Don't talk about dying, man. The question
now is to find a cab; if we can only move along
fast enough&mdash;What is the matter? Are you
stumbling?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. I think I struck a lamp-post. You
see&mdash;as I am blind&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Are you blind?" asked the stranger, anxiously.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Since when?"</p>

<p>"I was born blind."</p>

<p>Juan felt his companion's arm tremble in his,
and they walked along in silence. Suddenly the
man stopped and asked in a voice husky with
emotion,&mdash;</p>

<p>"What is your name?"</p>

<p>"Juan."</p>

<p>"Juan what?"</p>

<p>"Juan
<span class="replace" id="tn_4" title="In the printed book: Martinez">Martínez</span>."</p>

<p>"And your father was Manuel
<span class="replace" title="In the printed book: Martinez">Martínez</span>, wasn't
he,&mdash;musician of the third artillery band?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>The blind one felt the tight clasp of two powerful
arms that almost smothered him, and heard
a trembling voice exclaim,&mdash;</p>

<p>"My God, how horrible, and how happy!
I am a criminal, Juan! I am your brother
Santiago!"</p>

<p>And the two brothers stood sobbing together
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
in the middle of the street. The snow fell on
them lightly. Suddenly Santiago tore himself
from his brother's embrace, and began to shout,
intermingling his words with interjections,&mdash;</p>

<p>"A cab! A cab! Isn't there a cab anywhere
around? Curse my luck! Come, Juanillo, try;
make an effort, my boy; we are not so very far.
But where in the name of sense are all the cabs?
Not one has passed us. Ah, I see one coming,
thank God! No; the brute is going in the
other direction. Here is another. This one is
mine. Hello there, driver! Five dollars if you
take us flying to Number 13 Castellana."</p>

<p>And taking his brother in his arms as though
he had been a mere child, he put him in the cab
and jumped in after him. The driver whipped
his horse, and off they went, gliding swiftly and
noiselessly over the snow. In the mean time
Santiago, with his arms still around Juan, told him
something of his life. He had been in Costa
Rica, not Cuba, and had accumulated a respectable
fortune. He had spent many years in the
country, beyond mail service and far from any
point of communication with Europe. He had
written several letters to his father, and had managed
to get these on some steamer trading with
England, but had never received any answer.
In the hope of returning shortly to Spain, he had
made no inquiries. He had been in Madrid for
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
four months. He learned from the parish record
that his father was dead; but all he could discover
concerning Juan was vague and contradictory.
Some believed that he had died, while
others said that, reduced to the last stages of
misery, he went through the streets singing and
playing on the guitar. All his efforts to find him
had been fruitless; but fortunately Providence
had thrown him into his arms. Santiago laughed
and cried alternately, showing himself to be the
same frank, open-hearted, jovial soul that Juan
had loved so in his childhood. The cab finally
came to a stop. A man-servant opened the door,
and Juan was fairly lifted into the house. When
the door closed behind him, he breathed a warm
atmosphere full of that peculiar aroma of comfort
which wealth seems to exhale. His feet
sank in the soft carpet. Two servants relieved
him of his dripping clothes and brought him
clean linen and a warm dressing-gown. In the
same room, before a crackling wood fire, he was
served a comforting bowl of hot broth, followed
by something more substantial, which he was
made to take very slowly and with all the precautions
which his critical condition required.
Then a bottle of old wine was brought up from
the cellar. Santiago was too restless to sit still.
He came and went, giving orders, interrupting
himself every minute to say,&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span></p>

<p>"How do you feel now, Juan? Are you
warm enough? Perhaps you don't care for this
wine."</p>

<p>When the meal was over, the two brothers
sat silently side by side before the fire. Santiago
then inquired of one of the servants if the
Señora and the children had already retired.
On learning that they had, he said to Juan,
beaming with delight,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Can you play on the piano?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Come into the parlor, then. Let us give
them a surprise."</p>

<p>He accordingly led him into an adjoining
room and seated him at the piano. He raised
the top so as to obtain the greatest possible
vibration, threw open the doors, and went
through all the man&oelig;uvres peculiar to a surprise,&mdash;tiptoeing,
whispering, speaking in a falsetto,
and so much absurd pantomime that Juan
could not help laughing as he realized how little
his brother had changed.</p>

<p>"Now, Juanillo, play something startling, and
play it loud, with all your might."</p>

<p>The blind boy struck up a military march. A
quiver ran through the silent house like that
which stirs a music-box while it is being wound
up. The notes poured from the piano, hurrying,
jostling one another, but never losing their
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
triumphant rhythm. Every now and then Santiago
exclaimed,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Louder, Juanillo! Louder!"</p>

<p>And the blind boy struck the notes with all
his spirit and might.</p>

<p>"I see my wife peeping in from behind the
curtains. Go on, Juanillo. She is in her night-gown,&mdash;he,
he! I am pretending not to see her.
I have no doubt she thinks I am crazy,&mdash;he, he!
Go on, Juanillo."</p>

<p>Juan obeyed, although he thought the jest
had been carried far enough. He wanted to
know his sister-in-law and kiss his nephews.</p>

<p>"Now I can just see Manolita. Hello!
Paquito is up too. Didn't I tell you we should
surprise them? But I am afraid they will take
cold. Stop a minute, Juanito!"</p>

<p>And the infernal clamor was silenced.</p>

<p>"Come, Adela, Manolita, and Paquito, get
on your things and come in to see your uncle
Juan. This is Juanillo, of whom you have heard
me speak so often. I have just found him in
the street almost frozen to death. Come, hurry
and dress, all of you."</p>

<p>The whole family was soon ready, and rushed
in to embrace the blind boy. The wife's voice
was soft and harmonious. To Juan it sounded
like the voice of the Virgin. He discovered,
too, that she was weeping silently at the thought
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
of all his sufferings. She ordered a foot-warmer
to be brought in. She wrapped his legs in a
cloak and put a soft cushion behind his head.
The children stood around his chair, caressing
him, and all listened with tears to the accounts
of his past misery. Santiago struck his forehead;
the children stroked his hands, saying,&mdash;</p>

<p>"You will never be hungry again, will you,
uncle? Or go out without a cloak and an umbrella?
I don't want you to, neither does Manolita,
nor mamma, nor papa."</p>

<p>"I wager you will not give him your bed,
Paquito," said Santiago, trying to conceal his
tears under his affected merriment.</p>

<p>"My bed won't fit him, papa! But he can
have the bed in the guests' chamber. It is a
great bed, uncle, a big, big bed!"</p>

<p>"I don't believe I care to go to bed," said
Juan. "Not just now at any rate, I am so comfortable
here."</p>

<p>"That pain has gone, hasn't it, uncle?"
whispered Manolita, kissing and stroking his
hand.</p>

<p>"Yes, dear, yes,&mdash;God bless you! Nothing
pains me now. I am happy, very happy! Only
I feel sleepy, so sleepy that I can hardly raise
my eyelids."</p>

<p>"Never mind us; sleep if you feel like it,"
said Santiago.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, uncle, sleep," repeated the children.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>And Juan fell asleep,&mdash;but he wakened in
another world.</p>

<p>The next morning, at dawn, two policemen
stumbled against a corpse in the snow. The
doctor of the charity hospital pronounced it a
case of congealing of the blood.</p>

<p>As one of the officers turned him over, face
upward,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Look,
<span class="replace" id="tn_5" title="In the printed book: Jimenez">Jiménez</span>,"
said he; "he seems to be
laughing."</p>

  <h2>A CHRISTMAS IN THE FOREST.</h2>
  <p class="subh2">From the French of <span class="smcap">André Theuriet</span>.</p>
</div>

<div class="drop-cap">
  <img src="images/i_031.jpg" width="256" height="300" alt="Illustrated C" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Christmas Eve</span>
that
year was bleak and cold,
and the village seemed
benumbed. The houses
were closed hermetically,
and so were the
stables, from which came
the muffled sound of
animals chewing the
cud. From time to time the clacking of wooden
shoes on the hardened ground resounded through
the deserted streets, then a door was hastily
opened and closed, and all relapsed into silence.
It was evident from the thick smoke rising
through the chimneys into the gray air that every
family was huddled around its hearth while the
housewife prepared the Christmas supper. Stooping
forward, with their legs stretched out to the
fire, their countenances beaming with pleasure
at the prospect of the morrow's festival and the
foretaste of the fat and juicy blood-sausages, the
peasants laughed at the north wind that swept
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
the roads, at the frost that powdered the trees
of the forest, and the ice that seemed to vitrify
the streams and the river. Following their example,
my friend Tristan and I spent the livelong
day in the old house of the Abbatiale at the corner
of the hearth, smoking our pipes and reading
poetry. At sundown we had grown tired of
seclusion and determined to venture out.</p>

<p>"The forest must be a strange sight with this
heavy frost," said I to Tristan. "Suppose we
take a turn through the wood after supper; besides,
I must see the sabotiers from Courroy about
a little matter."</p>

<p>So we pulled on our gaiters, stuffed our pipes,
wrapped ourselves in our cloaks and mufflers,
and penetrated into the wood.</p>

<p>We walked along cheerfully over the rugged,
hardened soil of the trenches furrowed with deep,
frozen ruts. Through the copse on either side
we saw mysterious white depths. After a damp
night the north wind had transformed the mists
and vapors that overhung the branches into a
tangle of snowy lace. In the half light of the
gloaming we could still distinguish the sparkling
needles of the junipers, the frosted puffs of the
clematis, the bluish crystallizations of the beech,
and the silver filigree of the nut-trees. The
silence was broken by the occasional creaking of
the frozen limbs, and every now and then a
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
breath of impalpable white dust dampened our
cheeks as it melted there.</p>

<p>We walked along at a steady pace, and in less
than an hour caught sight of the red and flickering
glow of the sabotiers' camp pitched on the
edge of the forest above a stream that flowed
down toward the valley of Santonge. The settlement
consisted of a spacious, cone-shaped, dirt-coated
hut and a cabin with board walls carefully
sealed with moss. The hut answered the
combined purposes of dormitory and kitchen;
the cabin was used for the stowing away of
tools and wooden shoes, and also for the
two donkeys employed in the transportation of
goods. The sabotiers, masters, apprentices,
friends, and children were seated on beech logs
around the fire in front of the hut, and their
mobile silhouettes formed intensely black profiles
against the red of the fire. Three short posts
driven into the ground and drawn together at the
top formed the crane, from which hung an iron
pot that simmered over the coals. An appetizing
odor of stewed hare escaped from the tin lid as
it rose and fell under the puffs of vapor. The
master, a lively, nervous, hairy little man, welcomed
us with his usual cordiality.</p>

<p>"Sit down and warm yourselves," said he.
"You find us preparing the Christmas supper.
I'm afraid we'll not sleep over soundly to-night.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
My old woman is ill. I've fixed her a bed in
the cabin where she'll be more comfortable, and
warmer on account of the animals. My boy has
gone to Santonge to get the doctor. There's no
time to be lost. My little girl is kept busy running
from the cabin to the hut."</p>

<p>We had no sooner taken our seats around the
fire than the snowflakes began to whirl about in
the stillness above us. They fell so thick and
fast that in less than a quarter of an hour we
were compelled to protect the fire with a hurdle
covered with sackcloth.</p>

<p>"By my faith! gentlemen," said the sabotier,
"you'll not be able to start out again in this
storm. You'll have to stay and have your Christmas
supper with us,&mdash;and taste of our stew."</p>

<p>The weather was certainly not tempting, and
we accepted the invitation. Besides, the adventure
amused us, and we were delighted at the
prospect of a Christmas supper in the heart of
the forest. An hour later we were in the hut,
and by the light of a miserable little candle-end
we had our Christmas supper, devouring our
hare-stew with a sharp appetite and washing it
down with a draught of unfermented wine that
scraped our throats. The snow fell thicker and
thicker, wrapping the forest in a soft white wadding
that deadened every sound. Now and then
the sabotier rose and went into the cabin, then
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
came back looking worried, listening anxiously
for the good woman from Santonge. Suddenly
a few metallic notes, muffled by the snow, rose
softly from the depth of the valley. A similar
sound from an opposite direction rang out in
answer, then followed a third and a fourth, and
soon a vague confusion of Christmas chimes
floated over the forest.</p>

<p>Our hosts, without interrupting the process of
mastication and while they passed around the
wine-jug, tried to recognize the various chimes
by the fulness of the sounds.</p>

<p>"Those&mdash;now&mdash;those are the bells from
Vivey. They are hardly any louder than the
sound of the donkey's hoofs on the stones."</p>

<p>"That is the bell of Auberive!"</p>

<p>"Yes; and that peal that sounds like the
droning of a swarm of beetles, that's the
Grancey chimes."</p>

<p>During this discussion Tristan and I began to
succumb to the combined action of warmth and
fully satisfied appetite. Our eyes blinked, and
before we knew it we fell asleep on the moss of
the hut, lulled by the music of the Christmas
chimes. A piercing shriek followed by a sound
of joyful voices woke us with a start.</p>

<p>It had ceased snowing. The night was growing
pale, and through the little skylight we could
see above the fleecy trees a faint light in the
sky, where a belated star hung quivering.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span></p>

<p>"It is a boy!" shouted the master, bursting
in upon us. "Gentlemen, if you think you
would like to see him, why, I should be very
glad; and it might bring him luck."</p>

<p>We went crunching over the snow after him
to the cabin, lighted by a smoky lamp. On her
bed of laths and moss lay the young mother, weak
and exhausted, her head thrown back, her pale
face framed in by a mass of frowzy auburn hair.
The "good woman," assisted by the little girl,
was bundling up the new-comer, who wailed
feebly. The two donkeys, amazed at so much
stir and confusion, turned their kindly gray faces
toward the bed, shook their long ears, and gazed
around them with wide, intelligent eyes, blowing
through their nostrils puffs of warm vapor that
hung like a thin mist on the air. At the foot of
the bed stood a young shepherd, with a black
and white she-goat and a new-born kid.</p>

<p>"I have brought you the she-goat, Ma'am
Fleuriot," said he, in his Langrois drawl. "You
can have her for the boy as long as you wish."</p>

<p>The goat was baaing, the new-born child
wailed, and the donkeys breathed loudly. There
was something primitive and biblical about the
whole scene.</p>

<p>Without, in the violet light of the dawn, while
a distant church-bell scattered its early notes
through the air, one of the young apprentices,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
dancing in the snow to keep warm, sang out at
the top of his lungs that old Christmas carol,
which seemed then full of new meaning and
poetry,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry">
<p>"He is born, the little Child.</p>
<p class="i1">Ring out, hautbois! ring out, bagpipes!</p>
<p>He is born, the little Child;</p>
<p class="i1">Let us sing the happy news."</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">When</span>
Lucien de Hem saw
his last bill for a hundred
francs clawed by the
banker's rake, when he
rose from the roulette-table
where he had just
lost the débris of his little
fortune scraped together
for this supreme battle, he experienced
something like vertigo, and thought that he
should fall. His brain was muddled; his legs
were limp and trembling. He threw himself
upon the leather lounge that circumscribed the
gambling-table. For a few moments he mechanically
followed the clandestine proceedings of that
hell in which he had sullied the best years of his
youth, recognized the worn profiles of the gamblers
under the merciless glare of the three great
shadeless lamps, listened to the clicking and the
sliding of the gold over the felt, realized that he
was bankrupt, lost, remembered that in the top
drawer of his dressing-table lay a pair of pistols,&mdash;the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
very pistols of which General de Hem,
his father, had made noble use at the attack of
Zaatcha; then, overcome by exhaustion, he sank
into a heavy sleep.</p>

<p>When he awoke his mouth was clammy, and
his tongue stuck to his palate. He realized by a
hasty glance at the clock that he had scarcely
slept a half-hour, and he felt the imperious necessity
of going out to get a breath of the fresh
night air. The hands on the dial pointed exactly
to a quarter of twelve. As he rose and
stretched his arms it occurred to him that it was
Christmas Eve, and by one of those ironical
freaks of the memory, he felt as though he were
once more a child, ready to stand his little boot
on the hearth before going to bed. Just then
old Dronski, one of the pillars of the trade, the
traditional Pole, wrapped in the greasy worn
cloak adorned with frogs and passementerie,
came up to Lucien muttering something behind
his dirty grayish beard.</p>

<p>"Lend me five francs, will you, Monsieur?
I haven't stirred from this place for two days,
and for two whole days seventeen hasn't come
out once. You may laugh at me all you like, but
I'll bet you my fist that when the clock strikes
twelve, seventeen will be the winning number."</p>

<p>Lucien de Hem shrugged his shoulders; and
fumbling through his pockets, he found that he
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
had not even money enough to comply with that
feature of gambling etiquette known among the
frequenters of the establishment as "the Pole's
hundred cents." He passed into the antechamber,
put on his hat and cloak, and disappeared
down the narrow stairway with the agility of people
who have a fever. During the four hours
which Lucien had spent in the den it had
snowed heavily, and the street, one of those narrow
wedges between two rows of high buildings
in the very heart of Paris, was intensely white.
Above, in the calm blue black of the sky, cold
stars glittered. The exhausted gambler shivered
under his furs, and hurried along with a blank
despair in his heart, thinking of the pistols that
awaited him in the top drawer of his dressing-table.
He had not gone a hundred feet when
he stopped suddenly before a heart-rending
spectacle.</p>

<p>On a stone bench, near the monumental doorway
of a wealthy residence, sat a little girl six
or seven years old, barely covered by a ragged
black gown. She had fallen asleep there in spite
of the bitter cold, her body bent forward in a
pitiful posture of resigned exhaustion. Her
poor little head and her dainty shoulder had
moulded themselves into the angle of the freezing
wall. One of her worn slippers had fallen
from her dangling foot and lay in the snow
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
before her. Lucien de Hem mechanically
thrust his hand into his vest-pocket, but he remembered
that he had not even been able to
fee the club waiter. He went up to the child,
however, impelled by an instinct of pity. He
meant, no doubt, to pick her up and take her
home with him, to give her shelter for the night,
when suddenly he saw something glitter in the
little slipper at his feet. He stooped. It was a
louis-d'or.</p>

<p>Some charitable soul&mdash;a woman, no doubt&mdash;had
passed there, and at the pathetic sight
of that little shoe in the snow had remembered
the poetic Christmas legend, and with discreet
fingers had dropped a splendid gift, so that the
forsaken little one might still believe in the presents
of the Child-Christ, and might awake with
renewed faith in the midst of her misery.</p>

<p>A gold louis! That meant many days of rest
and comfort for the little beggar. Lucien was
just about to awaken her and surprise her with
her good fortune when, in a strange hallucination,
he heard a voice in his ear, which whispered
with the drawling inflection of the old
Pole: "I haven't stirred from this place for two
days, and for two whole days seventeen hasn't
come out once. I'll bet you my fist that when
the clock strikes twelve, seventeen will be the
winning number."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span></p>

<p>Then this youth, who was twenty-three years
of age, the descendant of a race of honest men,&mdash;this
youth who bore a great military name,
and had never been guilty of an unmanly act,&mdash;conceived
a monstrous thought; an insane
desire took possession of him. He looked anxiously
up and down the street, and having assured
himself that he had no witness, he knelt,
and reaching out cautiously with trembling
fingers, stole the treasure from the little shoe,
then rose with a spring and ran breathlessly
down the street. He rushed like a madman up
the stairs of the gambling-house, flung open the
door with his fist, and burst into the room at the
first stroke of midnight. He threw the gold-piece
on the table and cried,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Seventeen!"</p>

<p>Seventeen won. He then pushed the whole
pile on the "red." The red won. He left the
seventy-two louis on the same color. The red
came out again. He doubled the stakes, twice,
three times, and always with the same success.
Before him was a huge pile of gold and bank-notes.
He tried the "twelve," the "column,"&mdash;he
worked every combination. His luck was
something unheard of, something almost supernatural.
One might have believed that the little
ivory ball, in its frenzied dance around the table,
had been bewitched, magnetized by this feverish
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
gambler, and obeyed his will. With a few bold
strokes he had won back the bundle of bank-notes
which he had lost in the early part of the
evening. Then he staked two and three hundred
louis at a time, and as his fantastic luck
never failed him, he soon won back the whole
capital that had constituted his inherited fortune.</p>

<p>In his haste to begin the game he had not
even thought of taking off his fur-lined coat, the
great pockets of which were now swollen with
the rolls of bank-notes, and heavy with the
weight of the gold. Not knowing where to
put the money that was steadily accumulating
before him, he stuffed it away in the inside and
outside pockets of his coat, his vest, his trousers,
in his cigar-case, his handkerchief. Everything
became a recipient. And still he played and
still he won, his brain whirling the while like
that of a drunkard or a madman. It was amazing
to see him stand there throwing gold on the
table by the handful, with that haughty gesture of
absolute certainty and disdain. But withal there
was a gnawing at his heart, something that felt
like a red-hot iron there, and he could not rid
himself of the vision of the child asleep in the
snow,&mdash;the child whom he had robbed.</p>

<p>"In just a few minutes," said he, "I will go
back to her. She must be there in the same
place. Of course she must be there. It is no
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
crime, after all. I will make it right to her,&mdash;it
will be no crime. Quite the contrary. I
will leave here in a few moments, when the clock
strikes again, I swear it. Just as soon as the
clock strikes again I will stop, I will go straight
to where she is, I will take her up in my arms
and will carry her home with me asleep. I have
done her no harm; I have made a fortune for
her. I will keep her with me and educate her;
I will love her as I would a child of my own,
and I will take care of her,&mdash;always, as long
as she lives!"</p>

<p>But the clock struck one, a quarter past, half-past,
and Lucien was still there. Finally, a few
minutes before two the man opposite him rose
brusquely and said in a loud voice,&mdash;</p>

<p>"The bank is broken, gentlemen; this will do
for to-night."</p>

<p>Lucien started, and wedging his way brutally
through the group of gamblers, who pressed
around him in envious admiration, hurried out
into the street and ran as fast as he could toward
the stone bench. In a moment he saw by the
light of the gas that the child was still there.</p>

<p>"God be praised!" said he, and his heart
gave a great throb of joy. Yes, here she was!
He took her little hand in his. Poor little hand,
how cold it was! He caught her under the
arms and lifted her. Her head fell back, but
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
she did not awake. "The happy sleep of childhood!"
thought he. He pressed her close to
his breast to warm her, and with a vague presentiment
he tried to rouse her from this heavy
sleep by kissing her eyelids. But he realized
then with horror that through the child's half-open
lids her eyes were dull, glassy, fixed. A
distracting suspicion flashed through his mind.
He put his lips to the child's mouth; he felt no
breath.</p>

<p>While Lucien had been building a fortune
with the louis stolen from this little one, she,
homeless and forsaken, had perished with cold.</p>

<p>Lucien felt a suffocating knot at his throat.
In his anguish he tried to cry out; and in the
effort which he made he awoke from his nightmare,
and found himself on the leather lounge in
the gambling-room, where he had fallen asleep a
little before midnight. The <i>garçon</i> of the den
had gone home at about five o'clock, and out
of pity had not wakened him.</p>

<p>A misty December dawn made the window-panes
pale. Lucien went out, pawned his
watch, took a bath, then went over to the Bureau
of Recruits, and enlisted as a volunteer in the
First Regiment of the Chasseurs d'Afrique.</p>

<p>Lucien de Hem is now a lieutenant. He has
not a cent in the world but his pay. He manages
to make that do, however, for he is a steady
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
officer, and never touches a card. He even contrives
to economize, it would seem; for a few
days ago a comrade, who was following him up
one of the steep streets of the Kasba, saw him
stop to lay a piece of money in the lap of a little
Spanish girl who had fallen asleep in a doorway.
His comrade was startled at the poor
lieutenant's generosity, for this piece of money
was a gold louis.</p>

  <h2 class="nobreak">A CHRISTMAS SUPPER IN THE MARAIS.</h2>
  <p class="subh2">From the French of <span class="smcap">Alphonse Daudet</span>.</p>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">M<span class="noshow">. </span>Majesté</span>,
a seltzer-water
manufacturer of
the Marais, has just indulged
in a little Christmas
supper with a few
friends of the Place Royale, and walks home
humming. The clock at St. Paul's strikes two.
"How late it is!" thinks the good man as he
hurries along. But the pavement is slippery, the
streets are dark, and then, in this devil of an
old neighborhood which belongs to the time
when carriages were scarce, there are the greatest
number of turns, corners, steps, and posts in
front of the houses for the accommodation of
horsemen, all of which are calculated to impede
a man's progress, particularly when his legs are
heavy and his sight somewhat blurred by the
toasts of the Christmas supper. M. Majesté
reaches his destination at last, however. He
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
stops before a great doorway above which gleams
in the moonlight the freshly gilded coat-of-arms,
the recently retouched armorial-bearings which
he has converted into a trade-mark.</p>

<p class="centered">
Former<br />
Hôtel de Nesmond.<br />
<span class="smcap">Majesté, jr.</span>,<br />
Seltzer-water Manufacturer.<br />
</p>

<p>The old Nesmond coat-of-arms stands out, resplendent,
on all the siphons of the factory, on
all the memoranda and letter-heads.</p>

<p>The doorway leads directly to the court,&mdash;a
large, sunny court which floods the narrow
street with light even at noon, when the portals
are thrown open. Far back in this court stands
a great and ancient structure,&mdash;blackened walls
covered with lace-work and embroideries of
stone, bulging iron balconies, stone balconies
with pilasters, great high windows crowned with
pediments, and capitals rearing their heads along
the upper stories like so many little roofs within
the roof, then above it all, set in the very slate,
the mansard dormer-windows, like the round mirrors
of a boudoir, daintily framed with garlands.
From the court to the first story rises a great
stone stairway gnawed and worn green by the
rains. A meagre vine dangles along the wall,
lifeless and black like the rope that swings from
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
the pulley in the attic; and the whole has an indescribable
air of sad grandeur and decay.</p>

<p>This is the ancient Hôtel de Nesmond. In
the broad light of day it has quite a different
aspect. The words "Office," "Store," "Entrance
to the work-rooms," in bright gilt letters,
seem to rejuvenate the old walls and infuse a
new life into them. The drays from the railroad
shake the iron portals as they rumble
through, and the clerks step out on the landing
to receive the goods. The court is obstructed
with cases, baskets, straw, wrappers, and pack-cloth.
One is conscious of being in a factory.
But at night, in the death-like stillness, with the
winter moon casting and tangling fantastic shadows
through the confused intricacy of all these
roofs, the old dwelling of the Nesmonds resumes
its lordly air. The court of honor seems
to expand; the wrought-iron of the balconies
looks like fine lace; the old stairway is full of
shadows in the uncertain light, of mysterious recesses
like those of a cathedral; there are empty
niches and half concealed steps that suggest an
altar.</p>

<p>On this particular night M. Majesté is deeply
impressed with the grandeur of his dwelling.
The echo of his own footsteps startles him as
he crosses the great deserted court. The stairway
seems even broader than usual, and peculiarly
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
heavy to climb. But that is the Christmas
supper, no doubt. At the first landing he stops
to take breath; he leans on one of the window-sills.
So much for living in a historic mansion!
M. Majesté is certainly not a poet, oh, no!
and still as he gazes around him at this lordly
old place, which seems to be sleeping so peacefully
under its benumbed, snow-hooded roofs,
as he looks down into this grand, aristocratic
old court which the moon floods with a bluish
light, weird fancies flash through his brain.</p>

<p>"Suppose the Nesmonds should take it into
their heads to come back, eh?"</p>

<p>Just then there is a violent pull at the door-bell.
The portal swings open instantly, so brusquely
that it puts out the light of the lamp-post in the
court. From the shadow of the doorway come
rustling sounds and confused whisperings. There
seems to be a great crowd wrangling and jostling
to get in. There are footmen, a multitude of footmen,
coaches with glass panes glimmering in the
moonlight, sedan-chairs swaying lightly between
two torches whose long flames writhe and twist
in the draught of the doorway. In a second
the court is crowded; but at the foot of the
stairway the confusion ceases. People alight
from the coaches, recognize one another, smile,
bow, and make their way up the stairs, chatting
softly as though they were quite familiar with
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
the house. There is much rustling of silks and
clanking of swords on the landing, and billows
of white hair, heavy and dull with powder.
Through the faint sound of the airy tread comes
a thin, high quiver of voices and little peals of
laughter that has lost its vibration. All these
people seem old, very old,&mdash;eyes that have lost
their fire, slumbering jewels that have lost their
light, antique brocades that shimmer with a subdued
iridescence in the light of the torches,
and above it all a thin mist of powder that rises
at every courtesy from the white-puffed scaffoldings
of these stately heads. In a moment the
place seems to be haunted. Torches glitter
from window to window and up and down the
curving stairways; the very dormers in the
mansard twinkle with joy and life. The whole
mansion is ablaze with light, as though a great
burst of sunset had set its windows aglow.</p>

<p>"Merciful saints! they will set the house on
fire!" thinks M. Majesté; and having recovered
from his stupor, he makes an effort to shake
the numbness from his legs, and hurries down
into the court, where the footmen have just
lighted a great bonfire. M. Majesté goes up
to them, speaks to them; but they do not answer;
they stand there chatting among themselves
softly, and not the faintest breath issues
from their lips into the freezing shadow of the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
night. M. Majesté is somewhat put out. He is
reassured, however, when he realizes that this
great fire with its long straight flames is a most
peculiar fire, which emits no heat,&mdash;which simply
glows, but does not burn. The good man
therefore sets his mind at rest, goes upstairs
again, and makes his way into the store.</p>

<p>These stores on the first floor must have been
grand reception-halls in their day. Particles of
tarnished gold still cling to the angles. Mythological
frescos circle about the ceilings, wind
round the mirrors, hover above the doorways,
vague and subdued, like bygone memories. Unfortunately
there are no curtains or furniture
anywhere, nothing but baskets, great cases filled
with leaden-headed siphons, and the withered
limb of an old lilac bush rising in black outline
outside the window. M. Majesté enters. He
finds the rooms crowded and brilliantly illumined.
He bows, but nobody seems to notice him. The
women, in their satin wraps, lean on their cavaliers'
arms and flirt with ceremonious, mincing
graces. They promenade, chat, separate into
groups. All these old marquises really seem
quite at home. One little shade stops, all of a
quiver, before a painted pier-glass; then she
glances smilingly at a Diana that rises out of
the wood-work, lithe and roseate, with a crescent
on her brow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span></p>

<p>"This is I; think of it! And here I am!"</p>

<p>"Nesmond, come and see your crest!" and
they laugh immoderately at the sight of the Nesmond
coat-of-arms displayed on the wrappers
above the name of Majesté, Jr.</p>

<p>"Ha, ha, ha! Majesté! There are some
majesties left in France after all, then!"</p>

<p>And there is no end of merriment, of mincing
coquetries. Little trills of laughter rise like the
notes of a flute in the air. Some one exclaims
suddenly,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Champagne! champagne!"</p>

<p>"Nonsense!"</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed, champagne. Come, Countess,
what say you to a little Christmas supper?"</p>

<p>They have mistaken M. Majesté's seltzer-water
for champagne. They naturally find it
somewhat flat. But these poor little ghosts have
such unsteady heads! The foam of the seltzer-water
somehow excites them and makes them
feel like dancing. Minuets are immediately organized.
Four rare violinists provided by Nesmond
strike out with an old melody by Rameau,
full of triplets, quaint and melancholy in its vivacity;
and you should see the pretty little grandmothers
turn slowly and bow gravely in time
with the music.</p>

<p>Their very finery seems freshened and rejuvenated
by the sound, and so do the waistcoats
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
of cloth-of-gold, the brocaded coats and diamond-buckled
shoes. The panels themselves
seem to awake. The old mirror, scratched and
dim, which has stood encased in the wall for
over two hundred years, recognizes them all,
glows softly upon them, showing them their own
images with a pale vagueness like a tender
regret.</p>

<p>In the midst of all this elegance M. Majesté
feels somewhat ill at ease. He is huddled in a
corner, and looks on from behind a case of bottles.
But gradually the day dawns. Through
the glass doors of the store one can see the
court growing light, then the top of the windows,
then all one side of the great parlor. Before
the light of day the figures melt and disappear.
The four little violinists alone are belated in a
corner; and M. Majesté watches them evaporate
as the daylight creeps upon them. In the
court below he can just see the vague form
of a sedan-chair, a powdered head sprinkled
with emeralds, and the last spark of a torch that
a lackey has dropped on the pavement, and
which blends with the sparks from the wheels
of a dray, rumbling in noisily through the open
portals.</p>

  <p class="subh2">From the Spanish of <span class="smcap">Benito Pérez Galdós</span>.</p>

<h3>I.</h3>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Pacorrito Migajas</span>
was a great character. He
stood a trifle over two
feet from the ground, and
had just turned his seventh
year. His skin was tanned
by the sun and the wind,
and his wizened face suggested
a dwarf rather
than a child. His eyes,
adorned with long eyelashes that looked like
black wires, were full of vitality and resplendent
with mischief. His mouth was amazing in its
ugliness; and his ears, strangely like those of a
faun, seemed to have been attached to his face,
rather than to have grown there. He was
dressed in a shirt of every possible shade of
grime, and a pair of patchwork trousers upheld
by a single suspender. In the winter he wore a
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
coat which he had inherited from his grandfather.
The sleeves had been cut off at the
elbow, and Pacorrito considered it a handsome
fit, as overcoats go. A rag which aspired to
be a muffler was wound like a snake round and
round his neck, and on his head he wore a
cap which he had picked up at the Rastro. He
had little use for shoes, which he considered in
the light of a hindrance, neither did he wear
stockings, having a great aversion to the roughness
of the threads.</p>

<p>Pacorrito's ancestors could not have been
more illustrious. His father, accused of having
attempted to make his way into a house through
the drain, went to Ceuta for a change of climate,
and died there. His mother, a great lady who
for many years kept a chestnut-stand in the
Cava de San Miguel, had also fallen somehow
into the hands of the authorities, and after much
ado with judges and notaries, had repaired to
the
<span class="replace" id="tn_6" title="In the printed book: Alcala">Alcalá</span>
jail. Pacorrito had one sister, but
this last relative had deserted her post at the
tobacco factory and flown to Sevilla in amorous
pursuit of an artillery officer. Up to the present
she has not returned.</p>

<p>Migajas was therefore alone in the world,
with no protection but that of God, and no
guide but his own will.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span></p>


<h3>II.</h3>

<p>The pious reader need not fancy that Pacorrito
was in the least daunted or disturbed at
finding himself alone; not he. In his brief
career he had had occasion to study the ways of
the world, and he knew a thing or two about the
fraud and vanity of life. He filled himself with
energy and confronted the situation like a hero.
He was on excellent terms with numerous persons
of his age and quality, and even with
bearded men, who seemed disposed to protect
him, so by dint of push he got the better of his
sad condition.</p>

<p>He sold matches, newspapers, and lottery
tickets,&mdash;three branches of industry which, if intelligently
pursued, might certainly be productive
of honest gain. And so it happened that
Pacorrito was never in want of a penny or so to
assist a friend in need, or to treat his acquaintances
of the fair sex.</p>

<p>He was spared all domestic worries, all household
cares and exigencies. His palaces were
the Prado in summer, and the portals of the
<span class="replace" id="tn_7" title="In the printed book: casa panadería"><i>Casa Panadería</i></span>
in winter. By nature he was
frugal and wisely inimical to the pomps of the
world. He slept anywhere, ate whatever he
found, just as the birds do, and suffered no anxiety
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
on this score, because of the religious submissiveness
that filled his soul, and his instinctive
faith in that mysterious Providence which
deserts no one, great or small. One might be
apt to conclude from this that Migajas was
happy. It seems natural enough that he should
be. He was deprived of relatives, it is true, but
he enjoyed the precious boon of liberty. As his
wants were few, the fruit of his labor kept him in
plenty, and he was not indebted to any one for
anything. His sleep was disturbed neither by
cares nor ambition. He was poor but contented;
his body was destitute, but his spirit was
rich in peace. Well, in spite of all this, my
lord Pacorrito was unhappy. Why? Because
he was in love,&mdash;over ears in love, as they commonly
say.</p>

<p>Yes, sir, this very Pacorrito, who was so
small, so ugly, so poor, and so alone, loved.
Inexorable law of life, which permits no being,
whatever his condition, to elude the despotic
yoke of love! With a mind free from impure
thoughts, our hero loved. He loved with a
dreamer's idealism, yet at times he felt that ardent
fire which set the blood boiling like the very
devil in his veins. The object of his thoughts
aroused every variety of sensation in his volcanic
heart. He had days of sweet Platonicism, like
Petrarch, then again, he was warm and impetuous,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
like Romeo. And who, pray, had inspired
Pacorrito with this terrible passion? No less a
person than a great lady who wore silk and velvet
gowns, beautiful furs and gold eyeglasses,&mdash;a
great lady with flaxen ringlets that fell on her
alabaster neck, and who had been known to sit
at the piano for three days in succession.</p>


<h3>III.</h3>

<p>Who was this celestial beauty, and how came
Migajas to make her acquaintance? This is
how it happened: Our hero's mercantile operations
extended over a great part of one of the
streets opening into the Puerta del Sol,&mdash;a busy
thoroughfare lined with beautiful shops, the
show-windows of which are resplendent at night,
and display all the marvels of industry. One of
these stores, which is kept by a German, is always
full of exquisite trifles and novelties. It is
the great bazaar of childhood, both juvenile and
adult. During the Carnival it is hung with grotesque
masks; in Holy Week it is filled with
figures of saints and pious images. At Christmas
and New Year's it is all Bethlehem mangers
and Christmas-trees, laden with toys and
magnificent presents.</p>

<p>Pacorrito's mad passion began when the German
filled his show-window with the most enchanting
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
collection of richly dressed ladies that
Parisian fancy could conceive. Almost all of
them were two feet tall. Their faces were of
highly refined wax, and the crimson of fresh
roses could not equal the glow of their chaste
cheeks. Their immobile eyes of blue glass shone
with a splendor surpassing that of the human
pupil. Their hair of softest crimped wool could
with greater justice be compared to the rays of
the sun than that of most great ladies; and the
strawberries of April, the cherries of May, and
the coral from the deep seas were ugly things
compared to their lips. Their good breeding
and deportment were such that they never stirred
from the spot where they were placed. They
merely creaked the wooden joints of their knees,
their shoulders, and their elbows, when the German
sat them at the piano or made them raise
their eyeglasses to look out into the street.
Otherwise they were no trouble whatever, and no
one had ever heard them say, "This month is
mine."</p>

<p>There was one among them,&mdash;what a woman!
She was the tallest, the most lithe, the most
beautiful, the most sympathetic, the most elegant,&mdash;in
a word, the greatest lady of them all.
She was no doubt a person of high degree,
judging from her grave, grand manner and that
patronizing air which was so becoming to her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span></p>

<p>"Grand woman! She is the paragon!"
thought Pacorrito the first time he saw her, and
for a whole hour he stood before the show-window,
rooted to the sidewalk.</p>


<h3>IV.</h3>

<p>Pacorrito had reached the state of emotional
excitement, the delirium peculiar to heroes of
romance. His brain boiled; writhing, stinging
serpents wound themselves around his heart;
his mind was a volcano; he despised life; he
longed for death; he soliloquized; he gazed at
the moon; he soared beyond the seventh
heaven. Many a time had night overtaken him
in a melancholy ecstasy before the show-window,
oblivious to everything, oblivious to his
very business interests. It might be well to
state at once that our good Migajas met with no
rebuff. I mean that his mad passion was to a
certain extent reciprocated. Who can measure
the intensity of a heart of tow and sawdust?
The world is full of mysteries. Science is vain
and will never penetrate the depths of things.
Who will draw the line defining the exact sphere
of the inanimate? Where does the inanimate
begin? Down with the pedant who stands before
a stone or a cork and says, "Thou hast no
soul." God alone knows the true dimensions of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
the invisible limbo, wherein rests all that which
does not love.</p>

<p>Pacorrito was quite sure of having stirred his
lady's pulse. She gazed at him, and without
moving a muscle, opening her mouth, or winking
an eye, she spoke soulful things to him, now
sweet as hope, now sad like the prescience of
tragic events. This naturally fanned the flame
that burned in our friend's heart, and his daring
imagination conceived dramatic plans of conquest,
and even of matrimony.</p>

<p>One night the faithful lover repaired punctually
to the tryst. The lady was seated at the
piano, her hands suspended over the keys, and
her divine face turned to the street. The ragamuffin
and she exchanged glances; and what
passion, what idealism, in that look! Sighs and
tender thoughts were following one another,
when an event occurred which clipped the
thread of this sweet communion and shattered
at one blow the happiness of both lovers. It
was one of those sudden catastrophes that inflict
a mortal wound and lead to suicides, tragedies,
and other lamentable things.</p>

<p>A hand proceeding from the interior of the
shop was thrust into the show-window; it caught
the lady by the belt and disappeared with her
within. Pacorrito's amazement was followed by
a sense of misery so intense that he longed to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
die there and then. To see the object of his
love vanish as though she had been swallowed
by the insatiable grave, to be unable to rescue
her or follow her, were it to the bottomless pit,
ah, here was a blow which was beyond human
endurance!</p>

<p>Migajas was about to drop on the sidewalk.
He thought of suicide; he invoked God and the
Devil.</p>

<p>"They have sold her!" he muttered hoarsely;
and he pulled his hair and scratched his face
and kicked, and as he did so he dropped his
matches, his lottery tickets, and his newspapers.
Worldly interests, you are not worth a sigh!</p>


<h3>V.</h3>

<p>After a time, when he had recovered from his
violent emotion, he glanced toward the interior
of the store and saw two or three grown persons
and several little girls talking with the German.
One of these little girls held in her arms the
lady of his thoughts. He felt like rushing upon
them frantically, but he forbore, for it occurred
to him that his appearance was not in his favor,
and that there would be every chance of his getting
a sound drubbing and being handed over
to the police. He stood rooted to the threshold,
meditating upon the horrors of the slave-trade,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
upon this heinous Tyrolese institution wherein a
few dollars decided the fate of honest creatures,
exposing them to the savage destructiveness of
ill-bred children. Human nature appeared to
him in all its baseness. Those who had purchased
the lady left the shop and entered a luxurious
carriage. And how they laughed, the
wretches! Even the wee fellow, the most
petted and spoiled of them all, no doubt, took
the liberty of pulling the unfortunate doll by the
arms, although he had the greatest quantity of
toys appropriate to his age and for his own exclusive
enjoyment. The grown persons, too,
seemed satisfied with the new acquisition.</p>

<p>While the footman stood by to receive orders,
Pacorrito, who was a person of heroic and daring
resolutions, conceived the idea of swinging behind
the carriage. This he did with that agility
peculiar to the ragamuffin when he wishes to
take a ride across the city.</p>

<p>Stretching his neck to the right, he saw the
arm of the lady who had been sacrificed to lucre
sticking out of the window. This rigid arm and
its pink fist spoke forcibly to his imagination,
calling to him through the rumble of the wheels:</p>

<p>"Save me, save me, my Pacorrito!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span></p>


<h3>VI.</h3>

<p>Under the archway of the great dwelling before
which the carriage stopped, Pacorrito's illusion
vanished. A servant informed him that if
he soiled the flagstones with his muddy feet, he
would have his back-bone broken. Migajas retired
before this overwhelming argument, but
from that instant his heart was filled with a
scorching thirst for vengeance. His fiery nature
impelled him forward into the night of the
unforeseen, into the arms of his fortune. His soul
was well fitted to noisy and dramatic adventures,
so what should he do but make a compact with
those who removed the garbage from the house
where his beloved lived enslaved; and by this
means&mdash;which may not have been altogether
poetical, but which revealed the shrewdness of a
heart as big as the top of a pine-tree&mdash;he found
his way into the palace. How his heart throbbed
as he went up the stairs and into the kitchen!
The thought of being near her confused him so
that more than once his basket fell from his
hand, spilling its contents down the steps. But
nowhere could he see his lady-love. He often
heard the screams of children at play, but nothing
more.</p>

<p>The servants, because he was so little and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
so ugly, played many a trick upon him. One
alone, who seemed more compassionate than
the rest, gave him sweetmeats. One cold morning
the cook, through pity or through sheer wickedness
perhaps, gave him a draught of wine that
was as biting and fiery as the very devil. The
ragamuffin felt a warm and delightful current
run through his whole body while hot vapors
rose to his head. His legs trembled; his limp
arms fell beside him in voluptuous abandon.
A stream of playful laughter rose from his heart
and gurgled from his lips; and Pacorrito held on
to the wall with both hands to keep from falling.
A vigorous kick somewhat modified his mirth,
and he left the kitchen. His brain was topsy-turvy.
He had no idea where his steps were
leading him. He ran along staggering and
laughing, first over cold tiles, then over smooth
boarded floors, then over soft, warm carpets.
Suddenly he caught sight of an object on the
floor. He stood petrified for a second; then
he uttered a roar of pain and fell upon his
knees. Heavens! There, stretched before him
like a corpse, with a crack through her alabaster
brow, a broken arm, and dishevelled locks, was
the lady of his thoughts.</p>

<p>For a moment our hero was speechless. His
voice was smothered in his throat. He pressed
the cold body to his heart and covered it with
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
burning kisses. The lady's eyes were open,
and she gazed with melancholy tenderness at
her faithful lover, for she lived, in spite of her
wounds. Pacorrito knew it by the singular
light of her calm blue eyes, that emitted little
flames of love and gratitude.</p>

<p>"Señora, let me know who reduced you to this
sad condition!" he exclaimed in pathetic and
anguished tones. His pain was soon followed
by a burst of rage, and he thought of the great
revenge he would take upon the perpetrators of
the iniquity. Just then he heard footsteps approaching,
so he tucked the lady under his arm
and started on a run. He went down the stairs,
crossed the court, and broke into the street. He
could scarcely be said to be running; he was
flying, like a bird that has stolen grain, heard a
report, and feeling itself unhurt, determines to
put the greatest possible distance between itself
and the gun. He ran past one, two, three, ten
streets, till he thought he was far enough away
to be in safety, and then stopped to rest, laying
the object of his insensate tenderness upon his
knees.</p>


<h3>VII.</h3>

<p>Night came upon him, and he welcomed with
delight the soft shadows that hid the daring act
and protected his love. He examined her injured
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
body carefully, and concluded that the
wounds were not serious, although one might
have seen her brain, had she had one, through
the opening in her skull, and the sawdust of her
heart poured out in copious streams through the
rents in her breast. Her gown was in shreds,
and part of her hair had been dropped in the
hasty flight. His soul overflowed with sorrow
when he realized that he had not the money
with which to meet the situation. As he had
given up his business, naturally his pockets were
empty, and a loved woman, particularly if she
is in poor health, is a source of unlimited expense.
Migajas laid his hand sadly upon that
part of his rags wherein he had habitually kept
his coin, but nothing was there.</p>

<p>"At this critical moment," thought he, "when
I need a house, a bed, a world of doctors and
surgeons, an abundance of food, a bright fire
and a dressmaker, I have nothing&mdash;nothing!"</p>

<p>But as he was very tired, he laid his head
upon his idol's body and fell asleep like an
angel.</p>

<p>Then a great miracle took place. The lady
began to revive, and finally rising to her feet,
showed Pacorrito a smiling countenance. The
wound had disappeared from her noble brow;
her lithe form was without a rent, her gown neat
and whole. On her curled and perfumed locks<span
class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
she wore a coquettish hat trimmed with minute
flowers,&mdash;in a word, she stood before him in all
her beauty just as he had known her in the show-window.</p>

<p>Migajas was dazzled, stupefied, dumb. He
fell on his knees and worshipped her as people
do a divinity. Then she took the ragamuffin by
the hand, and in a voice clear, pure, and sweeter
than the song of the nightingale, she said to
him,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Pacorrito, follow me! I want to show you
my gratitude, and tell you of the sublime love
with which you have inspired me. You have
been loyal, constant, generous, heroic; you have
rescued me from the power of those Vandals
that tortured me. You deserve my heart and
my hand. Come, follow me! Do not be foolish;
do not think you are inferior to me because
you are in rags."</p>

<p>Migajas gazed at the lady's elegant, luxurious
attire and said sadly, "My lady, where can I
go in this dress?"</p>

<p>The lady did not answer; she merely led Pacorrito
by the hand into a mysterious region of
shadows.</p>

<p>The ragamuffin soon found himself in a grand
parlor brilliantly illumined and filled with beautiful
objects. The first moment of bewilderment
passed, he distinguished a thousand different<span
class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
figures and statuettes, like those that peopled
the shop in which he had seen his beloved for
the first time. What greatly surprised him was
to see all the fine ladies who in shimmering
gowns had occupied the show-window with his
friend come forth to meet them. His lady accepted
their homage with grave and ceremonious
courtesy. She seemed to belong to a higher
caste than they. Her queenly manner, her proud
though not haughty bearing, suggested dominion.
She immediately presented Pacorrito. For his
part he was much confused and grew redder
than a poppy when the princess, taking his hand,
said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Allow me to present to you the Señor Don
Pacorrito de las Migajas, who will honor us with
his presence to-night."</p>

<p>The wings of his heart drooped, as they say,
when he compared the luxury that surrounded
him with his own poverty, his rags, his bare feet,
his torn trousers upheld by a single suspender,
and his coat-sleeves cut off at the elbow.</p>

<p>"I can divine your thoughts," said the princess,
aside. "Your dress is not the most appropriate
for a celebration like this. As a matter
of fact, you are not presentable."</p>

<p>"Señora, that deuced tailor of mine," stammered
Migajas, "has been false to his word,
and&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span></p>

<p>"Never mind; we will dress you here," said
the noble lady.</p>

<p>The valets in this strange mansion were tiny
and very comical monkeys. Wee parrots of the
kind known as perricos acted as pages, to say
nothing of a great number of paper birds. They
immediately set to work to repair, as far as it
was possible, Pacorrito's unfortunate appearance.
They slipped his feet into a pair of tiny gilded
match-boxes that made the most stylish boots;
they cut a neck-cloth for him out of half a little
red paper lantern and turned an osier flower-pot
into a sort of pastoral hat which they trimmed
elaborately with flowers. As Pacorrito had never
been decorated, they took a metal plate from
an elegant Kepi and hung it around his neck,
by way of a decoration, and also a match-box,
which was round and looked like a watch, and
the cut-glass stopper of a small bottle of perfumery.
The paper birds conceived the happy
thought of putting an ivory paper-cutter in his
belt, to figure as a sword or dagger. Thanks to
these and numerous other inventions for concealing
his tatters, our friend looked so handsome
that no one would have recognized him.
As he caught sight of himself in the mirror-top
of a work-box, he swelled with pride. He was
radiant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span></p>


<h3>VIII.</h3>

<p>The ball now began. A number of canaries
from their respective cages sang waltzes and
<i>habaneras</i>. The cornets and the clarionets
too were very skilful in pressing their keys all
by themselves; the violins pinched their own
strings; and the trumpets blew into each other.
Migajas thought this music was entrancing. It
is unnecessary to say that the princess danced
with him. The other ladies found partners
among the officers of the army and the sovereigns
who had left their horses outside. Among
these were Prince Bismarck, the Emperor of
Germany, and Napoleon. Migajas was beside
himself with pride and excitement. It would
be impossible to describe the emotions of his
soul as he dashed into the dizzy whirls of
the waltz with his beloved in his arms. Her
soft breathing and an occasional stray lock
of her golden hair caressed his cheek, tickling
him gently and producing a strange intoxication.
A loving glance or a little sigh of fatigue
would every now and then put a climax to his
madness.</p>

<p>Suddenly the monkeys appeared and announced
supper. This caused a great commotion.
Migajas rejoiced greatly, for with no<span
class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
prejudice to the spiritual character of his love,
the poor little fellow was very hungry.</p>


<h3>IX.</h3>

<p>The dining-hall was superb and the table exquisite.
The china was of the very finest manufactured
for dolls, and a multitude of bouquets
showed their colors and scattered their fragrance
from egg-stands and thimbles. Pacorrito sat at
the princess's right. They began to eat. The
parrots and paper birds waited upon them with
such order and rapidity that they seemed like
soldiers drilling before their general. The dishes
were delicious. Everything was raw, or at all
events cold. Migajas was rather pleased with
the supper at first, but he was soon surfeited.
The menu was as follows: bits of sponge cake,
turkeys smaller than birds, which one could
swallow at a mouthful, gilt-heads no bigger than
almonds, a rich supply of hemp-seed, a pâté
of bird-seed à la Canaria, bread-crumb à la
perdigona, a fricassée of pheasants' eyes with
a sauce of wild mulberries, a salad of moss,
delicious sweetmeats, and every possible variety
of fruit, harvested by the parrots from the tapestries
where they were embroidered, the melons
being as small as grapes and the grapes as small
as lentils. During the supper the company chat<span
class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>tered
ceaselessly,&mdash;all but Migajas, who, being
short of wit, sat there and said never a word.
He was confused in the presence of so many
gold-corded and uniformed generals. He was
amazed, too, at finding so much loquacity and
frolicsomeness in these great men, who had
stood stiff and dumb in the show-window as
though they were made of clay.</p>

<p>The one known as Bismarck, in particular,
never stopped to draw breath. He said the
wildest things imaginable, pounded the table
with his fist, and threw bread balls at the princess.
He flung his arms about most marvellously,
just as though a string were attached to
their hinges, and somebody under the table had
hold of it.</p>

<p>"What fun I am having!" said the chancellor.
"My dear princess, when a man spends
his life adorning a mantel-piece in the cheerful
company of a clock, a bronze figure, and a pot
of begonias, he really needs recreation; and at a
festival like this he lays in a supply of mirth for
the year."</p>

<p>"Ah, happy, a thousand times happy, they
whose only duty consists in adorning mantelpieces!"
said the lady, in melancholy tones. "It
may be wearisome, but you do not at least suffer
as we do,&mdash;we whose lives are a prolonged
martyrdom; we, the toys of the small men.<span
class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
It would be impossible for me to make you understand,
Prince Bismarck, what we suffer when
one pulls our right arm, another our left; when
this one cracks our head, that one quarters us
or leaves us in the water to soak, or rips us open
to find out what is inside of us!"</p>

<p>"I can imagine it," said the chancellor, opening
his arms and clapping them together several
times.</p>

<p>"How unfortunate!" said Espartero and two
of the emperors at once.</p>

<p>"I was the least unfortunate of all," said the
lady, "for I found a friend and protector in the
valorous and faithful Migajas, who managed to
save me from the barbarous torture."</p>

<p>Pacorrito blushed to the very roots of his
hair.</p>

<p>"Valorous and faithful!" repeated all the
dolls, in admiring chorus.</p>

<p>"And therefore to-night, when our Genius
Creator permits us to come together for this great
celebration, I chose to honor him by bringing him
with me and offering him my hand as a sign of
alliance and reconciliation between the lineage
of dolls and that of well-bred, compassionate
children."</p>

<h3>X.</h3>

<p>At this Prince Bismarck looked at Pacorrito
with an expression of such malignity and sarcasm
that our illustrious hero was filled with wrath.
At the same instant this wretch of a chancellor
aimed a bread ball at Migajas, and fired it
so accurately that the bridegroom came near
being blinded for life. But Migajas was a prototype
of prudence and circumspection, so he
controlled his feelings and was silent. The
princess threw him a glance of love and
gratitude.</p>

<p>"What fun I am having!" repeated the chancellor,
clapping his wooden hands together.
"Before it is time to resume our place beside
the clock and listen to its unceasing tic-tac, let
us fathom the depths of pleasure and intoxication,&mdash;let
us be happy! If the Señor Pacorrito
would favor us by calling the daily paper,
we might laugh a little."</p>

<p>"The Señor de Migajas," said the princess,
kindly, "did not come here to make us laugh.
But there is no reason why we should not enjoy
hearing him call out the paper or even matches
if he is willing to do so."</p>

<p>The ragamuffin could find no words with
which to answer his beloved. He was sorely<span
class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
incensed at the proposition, which he judged to
be a fling at his dignity and decorum.</p>

<p>"Let him dance!" shouted the chancellor,
impertinently; "let him dance on the table!
and if he refuse to do so, I move that he be
stripped of the fine clothes we dressed him in,
and be left ragged and barefooted as he was
when he came."</p>

<p>Migajas felt all his blood rush to his heart.
He was blind with rage. "Do not be cruel, my
dear prince," said the princess, smiling; "leave
him to me. I will take it upon myself to dispel
the storm that is rising within our good Migajas
here."</p>

<p>A loud peal of laughter greeted this reply, and
all the dolls, and the most celebrated generals
and emperors of the world, simultaneously fell
to pounding one another's heads like the Punch
and Judy puppets.</p>

<p>"Make him dance! make him call matches!"
they clamored.</p>

<p>Migajas felt faint. The sentiment of dignity
was so powerfully developed in him that he
would have died rather than have gone through
the suggested degradation. He was just about
to reply when the malignant chancellor, pulling
a long thin straw from a work-basket and wetting
the end of it in his mouth, drove it into Pacorrito's
ear with such a quick movement that<span
class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
the latter did not realize the familiarity of the
act until he had suffered the nervous shock
produced by tricks of this sort.</p>

<p>Blind with rage, he put his hand to his belt
and drew the paper-cutter. The ladies shrieked
and the princess fainted; but the enraged Migajas,
far from being pacified by this, seemed
to be growing more and more infuriated, and
rushing upon his insolent adversary, he began to
deal blows right and left. The air was filled
with yells, threats, and imprecations. The parrots
croaked and the very birds moved their
paper tails in sign of panic.</p>

<p>Nobody laughed now at the daring Migajas.
A few moments later the chancellor might have
been seen going about gathering up his arms
and legs (a strange case which cannot be explained),
and all the emperors were noseless.
They gradually, however, with a little glue and a
great deal of innate skill, mended one another,&mdash;a
rare advantage, this, of puppet surgery.
The princess, having recovered from her swoon
through the virtue of smelling-salts, administered
by her pages in a filbert-shell, called the ragamuffin
aside, and leading him to her private
apartments, spoke as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span></p>


<h3>XI.</h3>

<p>"Most illustrious Migajas, what you have just
done, far from lessening my love for you, has
only increased it, for you have given evidence of
indomitable valor by your easy triumph over
this swarm of scoffing puppets, the most despicable
class of beings on earth. The tender sentiments
that bind me to you move me to propose
that you become my husband with no further
delay."</p>

<p>Pacorrito fell on his knees.</p>

<p>"As soon as we are married, the emperors and
chancellors will all venerate you as they do me,
for I must tell you that I am queen of this division
of the world. My titles are not usurped;
they are transmitted by the divine law of puppets
established by the Supreme Genius that
created us and governs us."</p>

<p>"My lady," Migajas said, or tried to say,
"my happiness is so great that I cannot express
it."</p>

<p>"Very well, then," said the lady, with great
majesty, "since you are willing to become my
husband, and consequently prince and lord of
this puppet kingdom, I must inform you that in
order to do so you will have to renounce your
human personality."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span></p>

<p>"I do not exactly grasp your Majesty's meaning,"
said the ragamuffin.</p>

<p>"You belong to the human race. I do not.
Our natures being different, we cannot unite.
There is but one way. Give up your humanity.
It is the easiest thing in the world, believe me.
It is only necessary that you will it. Now, answer
me. Pacorrito, son of man, will you be
a puppet?"</p>

<p>The peculiar nature of this request set the
ragamuffin to thinking for a few seconds.</p>

<p>"And what does this thing of being a puppet
consist in?"</p>

<p>"You will be like me. Our nature is perhaps
nearer perfection than yours. We are to
all appearances devoid of life, but we live, believe
me. To the imperfect senses of man we
lack movement, words, affection, but this is far
from being the case. You have had an opportunity
of judging how we move, how we speak,
and how we feel. Our fate, for the present at
least, is not a very happy one. We are the toys
of your children, and even your men, but as
a compensation for this disadvantage we are
eternal."</p>

<p>"Eternal!"</p>

<p>"Yes; we live forever. When these wicked
children of yours break us, we rise with a new
life out of our destruction, and are born anew,<span
class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
describing a mysterious and everlasting circle
from the shop to the children, from them to the
Tyrolese factory, and thence to the shop again
through the ages everlasting."</p>

<p>"Through the ages everlasting!" repeated
Migajas, absorbed.</p>

<p>"It is not always rose-color with us; but, on
the other hand, you see, we do not know death,
and then our Genius Creator permits us to meet
at certain great festivals to celebrate the glory of
our race, as we have done to-night. We cannot
elude the laws of our being,&mdash;it is not given us
to enter the reign of humanity, although men
can easily enter ours, and in fact have very often
been known to become puppets."</p>

<p>"A most extraordinary thing!" exclaimed
Pacorrito, full of amazement.</p>

<p>"You know the requirements of puppet initiation.
I have nothing more to say. Our dogmas
are very simple. Now, meditate upon it,
and answer my question, Will you be a doll?"</p>

<p>The princess's attitude was that of a priestess
of antiquity. Pacorrito was captivated.</p>

<p>"I want to be a doll," declared the ragamuffin,
resolutely.</p>

<p>The princess then proceeded to trace diabolical
characters in the air, and to utter great words
which Pacorrito had never heard before, and
which were neither Latin, Chinese, nor Chal<span
class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>dean.
He concluded that they were Tyrolese.
When this was consummated, the lady threw her
arms about Migajas, saying,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Now you are my husband. I have the
power of marrying, and also of receiving neophytes
into our Great Law. My darling little
prince, may you be blessed through time everlasting!"
And the whole court of figures entered,
singing, "Through time everlasting!"
to the accompaniment of canaries and nightingales.</p>


<h3>XII.</h3>

<p>They all promenaded through the parlors in
couples. Migajas gave his arm to his royal
consort.</p>

<p>"What a pity," said she, "that our hours of
pleasure should be so brief! Soon we shall have
to return to our places."</p>

<p>His Serene Highness, Migajas, from the moment
of his transformation, had begun to experience
the queerest sensations. The strangest
of these consisted in his having lost the sense
of taste and the notion of food. All he had
eaten lay within him as though his stomach had
been a basket containing a thousand pasteboard
viands which he did not digest, which had no
substance, weight, taste, or nourishment. Moreover,
he was no longer master of his movements,<span
class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
and was compelled to keep time when he walked,
which was a difficult thing to do. He felt himself
growing hard, as though he were being
turned to bone, wood, or clay. He thumped
himself, and behold! his body resounded like
porcelain. His clothes, too, had grown hard,
and were in every respect precisely like his body.</p>

<p>When he found himself alone with his little
wife and clasped her to his bosom, he experienced
no human or divine sensation of pleasure,&mdash;nothing
but the harsh shock of two hard, cold
bodies. He kissed her cheek; it was frozen.
In vain did his hungry spirit call upon nature.
Nature in him was what it is in a piece of pottery.
He felt his heart throbbing like the machinery
of a watch. His thoughts alone survived;
the rest was all unfeeling matter.</p>

<p>The princess seemed very happy. "What is
the matter, my love?" said she, observing
Pacorrito's expression of distress.</p>

<p>"I am weary, bored, bored to death, my dear,"
said the lover, gaining assurance.</p>

<p>"You will get accustomed to it. O happy
hours! If this lasted much longer, we could not
endure it!"</p>

<p>"Does your Highness call this happiness?"
observed Migajas. "What coldness, what emptiness,
what rigidity!"</p>

<p>"The after-taste of human things still lingers<span
class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
in your soul, and you are still a slave to the views
of your depraved human senses. Pacorrito, I
shall have to implore you to control these paroxysms,
or you will be the demoralization and
destruction of every living doll."</p>

<p>"Life! life! blood! heat!" shouted Migajas,
in despair, gesticulating like a maniac. "What
is happening to me?"</p>

<p>The princess clasped him to her bosom, and
kissing him with her red, waxen lips, exclaimed:</p>

<p>"You are mine, forever, forever, through time
everlasting!"</p>

<p>Just then they heard a great commotion, and
the sound of many voices crying,&mdash;</p>

<p>"It is time! it is time!"</p>

<p>The clock struck twelve, and all had disappeared,
princess, palace, dolls, and emperors.
Pacorrito was left alone.</p>


<h3>XIII.</h3>

<p>He was left alone in the most complete darkness.
He tried to scream, but he was voiceless.
He made frantic attempts to move, but he could
not; he had turned to stone.</p>

<p>He waited in anguish. Day dawned at last;
and Pacorrito had resumed his old appearance,
but strange to say, he was all of one color, and
apparently all of one substance,&mdash;his hands, his<span
class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
arms, his rags, his hair, and even the newspapers
which he held in his hand.</p>

<p>"There is no doubt about it," said he; "I
have turned into a stone."</p>

<p>Before him he saw a great sheet of plate-glass,
with some letters on it, running backward.
Around him was a multitude of statuettes and
fancy ornaments.</p>

<p>"Horror! I must be in the show-window!"</p>

<p>A clerk took him carefully in his hands, and
having dusted him, put him back in his place.</p>

<p>His Serene Highness looked down upon the
pedestal on which he stood, and saw a card with
the figures $12.00 upon it.</p>

<p>"Good heavens! I am worth a treasure!
That, at least, partially consoles one."</p>

<p>And the people stopped on the other side of
the plate-glass to admire the wonderful bit of
clay statuary representing a ragamuffin selling
matches and newspapers. Everybody praised
the artist, and laughed at the droll expression
and bungling figure of the great Migajas, while
he in the inmost recesses of his clay repeated
in anguish,&mdash;</p>

<p>"A puppet! a puppet! forever! through
time everlasting!"</p>

  <h2>A TRAGEDY.</h2>
  <p class="subh2">From the Spanish of <span class="smcap">Antonio Maré</span>.</p>
</div>

<div class="drop-cap">
  <img src="images/i_089.jpg" width="212" height="300" alt="Illustrated I" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">It</span>
was a great city in the far
North, a gloomy city with
pointed roofs that seemed
to have been carved out
of the fog. The birds
that hurried past it on
their journey south said
to themselves that it
looked like a forest of
steeples. Under one of
these pointed roofs lived
two young people whom the coldness of emigration
had huddled together in a closer intimacy.
They were very unconscious of the fog, and it
never occurred to them that the city looked like
a forest of steeples; in fact, they never thought
of the city at all, and would scarcely have been
surprised if they had heard it spoken of as an
orange grove,&mdash;for they were lovers. The little
nest they had built themselves under the pointed
roof was bright with the sunshine that came from
them; and the few people who entered there became
intoxicated with a strange aroma of tender<span
class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>ness
that surged to their brains like the fumes of
old wine, in sweet reminiscences or disturbing
suggestions.</p>

<p>It would not be perfectly correct to say that
these young people lived entirely alone; and had
they not been so absorbed in each other, living
that life of double selfishness peculiar to lovers,
they could scarcely have helped feeling a soft blue
gaze fixed upon them, evening after evening, as
they took their accustomed places before the
hearth.</p>

<p>On the mantel-piece which overhung the
hearth was a small black marble clock, a statuette
of Psyche with butterfly wings made of
plaster, a little Italian shepherd of very primitively
tinted clay, and a bisque vase. Now, this
vase was the gem of the drawing-room. On its
bosom was painted a running stream that broke
into cataracts here and there over glossy brown
stones. Its pitch was amazingly abrupt. It
started at the brim of the vase and disappeared
under it. On its banks, far away in a
misty perspective of pink and violet trees, were
a number of shadowy little shepherdesses, some
carrying tender lambs, others dancing the minuet,
but all very blithe and merry. At some distance
from them, and at the very front, where the cataract
roared its loudest, stood a much larger shepherdess
in clear relief, thrusting herself boldly<span
class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
forward as though she meant to leap from the
parental vase, to which she was bound only by
the tip of her flowered skirt and the heel of her
slippered foot. She held her crook high in the
air as if to balance herself in her flight. In her
other hand was a wreath of corn-flowers, with
which she shaded a pair of dreamy blue eyes
that gazed in perpetual wonder at the world below.
Her sisters were simple little things, who
were content to play with a lambkin all day long
in the sun, or dance the minuet under the trees,
but who had absolutely no ideas. Now, this
particular little shepherdess had not only ideas,
she had thoughts, and what was more, she was
conscious of them. It was not to be wondered
at that all things fell in love with each other in
this peculiar little room; nor was it surprising
that most things fell in love with the little shepherdess.
The wonder was that she, on the other
hand, fell in love with nothing. This superiority
of thought was very isolating, and her aloneness
would have been unendurable but for the gratifying
nature of its cause. The clock was an unpleasant
neighbor,&mdash;childless and critical, which
sometimes means the same thing. Its conversation
invariably took the form of a colloquy, stiff
with rules, bristling with maxims; besides, having
gone through life measuring out time, it had
reached that stage of indiscriminate scepticism<span
class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
which is the greatest possible damper on the
open-mindedness of others.</p>

<p>There was the little clay shepherd, to be sure,
who was very well thought of by the community
at large. The shepherdess liked him,&mdash;certainly
she liked him,&mdash;and she sometimes spoke
her thoughts to him, but she never could have
loved him, had the drawing-room been the Desert
of Sahara and he its only other inhabitant.
She was always perfectly frank with him whenever
he broached the subject.</p>

<p>"In the first place, I do not believe that you
are really in love," she said to him kindly;
"you only think you are, because everybody
else seems to be. Reflect a little, and I am sure
you will agree with me,&mdash;for my part, I have
given it a great deal of serious thought. The
air seems full of thrills for all of you lately, but
you should be very careful; a thrill is a dangerous
prism through which to look at life." And
to herself she said, "Poor little fellow! he thinks
he can build a bonfire out of two straws."</p>

<p>She could not associate love with his healthy
plumpness. He was even-tempered, and had an
occasional idea, but no theories; he wanted
things without longing for them; his love was
tender but not invariably delicate. She felt the
fault to be in his head rather than in his heart;
he always acquiesced, but seldom understood.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span></p>

<p>On the table in the centre of the room was a
Chinese mandarin, who was also in love with the
little shepherdess, but she absolutely abhorred
him. To her mind he was coarse and repulsive,
in spite of his wealth. His jokes never amused
her. Still he was a humorist, and had a way of
wobbling his head and poking out his tongue
that threw the whole drawing-room into convulsions
of laughter. Poor little shepherdess! Well,
she did what we all do under similar circumstances.
She built herself a world of her own,&mdash;a
little intellectual laboratory into which she
dragged bits of careful observation to be submitted
to the tests of her theories. So, poised
like a sparrow on a twig, she continued to peer
over the edge of the mantel-piece, where she saw
quite enough to set her thinking.</p>

<p>Her master and mistress were a source of
constant study to her. Late in the evening,
when he sat on a broad, low chair before the fire,
and she on the floor resting her head against his
knees, the little shepherdess's eyes fairly glowed
with concentrated attention. "So that must be
love," she thought, as she made a note of something
indefinable that quivered on their lips, or
trembled on their eyelids and made them droop.
"I wonder how they feel! I wish I knew!"
She was watching her mistress with peculiar interest
one night, when she saw her slip her hand<span
class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
into her husband's coat-pocket, and draw out an
envelope with no stamp upon it. This she held
for a second or two, undecided as to whether
she would read its contents. She looked up inquiringly
at her husband, then with a quick
movement thrust it back unopened, and laughingly
threw her arms about his neck to drive
away the unpleasant impression. "That is a
grave mistake," thought the little shepherdess.
"Why should there be anything that he should
not want her to know? As a principle, it is
wrong. It is because people build their love on
illusions that they fear revelations. Why are
they so cowardly? I do not believe the truth to
be as black as it is painted. We should love,
knowing,&mdash;that is the way. There must be such
a thing. Oh, when I love&mdash;" and her eyes
grew misty at the very thought, and the lace on
her little bodice rose and fell.</p>

<p>The days came and went, and found her
growing ever more dainty, and more thoughtful
too. At last she opened her blue eyes, one
Christmas Eve, upon what struck her at first as
something alarming. It was midnight; and a
stealthy sound of creaking boots awoke her from
her first sleep and in the very midst of a wonderful
dream. Her little heart was beating very
fast. At first she thought it might be a burglar who
had heard of her cleverness and her philosophies,<span
class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
and who had broken into the house to steal her
away, but in a second a match was struck and
she understood her mistake. Her master stood
before her in the middle of the room. She saw
him tiptoe to the door, close it tightly, then stand
listening for a moment before lighting the gas.
What could he be so mysterious about? She
rubbed her eyes and watched him attentively.
She soon discovered that he held a bundle under
his arm, and she smiled to herself knowingly.
"A Christmas present," she said; and she leaned
so far forward that she almost tipped off the
mantel-piece. Her master sat down, laid the
package on his lap, and cut the strings with his
penknife; then he removed the wrappings as
noiselessly as possible. Though the little shepherdess
had entirely recovered from her alarm,
she began to experience a sensation entirely new
to her. She felt as though there were a tight
band around her waist that kept her from breathing
freely. Her head grew hollow; and a sickened
sense of misery&mdash;physical and mental
anguishes writhing and knotting themselves in
the pit of her stomach&mdash;made her feel strangely
faint. What could this mean? Was it a foreboding?
When the last wrapping was carefully
laid aside, she opened her eyes with a great effort
and looked upon the most beautiful thing
she had ever seen. On the little table directly<span
class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
opposite her, stood a figure about eight inches
high,&mdash;exquisite, dazzling! "A prince!" she
thought at first; for he was richly dressed, had a
noble air, and on his short dark curls he wore a
crown. But no; he was not a prince.</p>

<p>As she looked at him again she realized that
his crown was made of laurels; then she saw too
that he held a violin in his hand. He was something
greater than a prince; he was an artist.
The master stood off and looked at him with
beaming joy, and the little shepherdess felt her
admiration increase with corroboration. Then
he drew from his pocket a pink wax taper, which
he fitted into the laurel crown. When it was
lighted it shed a soft radiance. "What a beautiful
idea!" thought the shepherdess; "that is the
halo of art, glorifying, transfiguring everything."
The master then blew out the light, and smiling
complacently, reached up to the chandelier.
Just as he was about to turn out the gas, the little
artist looked up and saw the shepherdess,&mdash;one
long look of surprise and eagerness; their
glances met, and in that look they understood
each other. Through the darkness of that whole
night he played her beautiful strains of dreamy
music that opened to her visions of blue skies
and balmy orange groves; for he came from Italy,
where the very air must be heavy with poetry
and love, she thought. He told her wonderful<span
class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
tales with his violin. He alternately flooded her
mind with moonlight and fairies, or peopled her
fancy with vague forms of sorrow that filled her
little breast with sobs. What a rapturous night
that was! A bewitched moonbeam that peered
in through a broken slat in the blind lay there
entranced. In the pauses of the music the plaster
wings of the little Psyche quivered audibly.
As for the shepherdess, something had permeated
her soul like a subtile essence, and
opened one by one great vistas of feeling of
which she had never dreamed even in the boldest
flights of her imaginings. All her senses
seemed suddenly to have grown exquisitely
acute. "What a bursting heart there must be
behind it all!" she thought. "What a fund of
sentiment! What must he feel who, with a
stroke of his bow, can change the aspect of the
world! It is he! It is he at last!"</p>

<p>Christmas morning dawned upon the world.
The first rays of light that penetrated into the
drawing-room brought with them the muffled
sound of carriages hurrying over the snow, and
the occasional shout of a belated reveller mingling
with the faint murmur from groups of early
church-goers. But what was this to the little
shepherdess? The day that had dawned for her
was more momentous than Christmas. She was
almost surprised to find that it was not a dream.<span
class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
No, there he stood; and he smiled at her with
the eager smile of those who meet again after a
separation.</p>

<p>"You look as though you were about to take
flight, you beautiful, blue-eyed thing. Fly down
to me. I will catch you in my arms," he said,
at which the little shepherdess blushed crimson.
"Perhaps you do not love me now that you see
me in the light of day."</p>

<p>She was just about to answer something very
clever about not fearing revelations because she
had all her life scorned illusions, when the door
suddenly opened, and her master entered on tiptoe.
He walked over to the table, stood looking
at his purchase with satisfaction for a few seconds;
then taking it up in his hand, he discovered
that the pink taper did not fit tightly enough into
the little laurel crown. In moving the figure, it
was apt to topple first to one side, then another.
So he stood it down, and twisting the upper part
carefully, he screwed it off, crown and taper,
from the pretty head, and carried them both
into the next room. During this incident a
thought flashed through the little shepherdess's
mind, and like a flash too she determined to
execute it. She pulled her left foot with a
jerk, and gave a little tug at her gown, and there
she stood on the edge of the mantel-piece, free.
She threw a hasty glance at the little shepherd,<span
class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
who looked on with a parched throat; it is even
possible that she smiled a kindly smile upon the
black clock. Then she gathered her skirts with
both hands and jumped down. It was a supreme
moment. The lovers stood looking into each
other's eyes.</p>

<p>"My precious one," he said, "you are mine
at last. I have waited for you through the ages,
and you have come!"</p>

<p>And the little shepherdess, stepping up on a
book, held her wreath of corn-flowers over his
head.</p>

<p>"I have no laurels to bring you," she said,
"but I will crown you with my trusting love."
And she rose on her tiptoes and leaned forward
to lay her corn-flowers on his brow. But what
was it? Why did she start, and then lean farther
forward and look again? What could she have
seen to make her eyes grow suddenly dim,&mdash;those
clear eyes that meant to see everything?</p>

<p>The fact of it was that under the laurels it was
all hollow, hollow down to his belt. Where his
heart should have been, she saw a little dust that
exhaled a musty odor, and the wings of several
dead flies. Her brain reeled. Was this all, then?
And the music, where had the wonderful music
come from, or was the music all? This was
the shepherdess's last speculation. She felt the
book sinking beneath her little feet; she grasped<span
class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
her crook nervously; then there was a blank in
her thoughts; she tottered, and crash! she fell
and broke into a thousand pieces at the feet of
her lover. At first he felt that he would die too.
Then he composed himself, and when he came
to understand how it had all happened, he
shrugged his shoulders. "Women are all alike,"
said he. "They fancy they are thinking when
they are only brooding. They want to be analytical,
and they are only cavilous." And he
tuned his violin, while his eyes rested on the little
plaster Psyche.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Two</span>
truffled turkeys, did you say,
Garrigou?"</p>

<p>"Yes, my reverend,
two great, glorious turkeys
stuffed with truffles.
I ought to know something
about it, considering
I helped stuff them
myself. I thought their
skins would crack while they were roasting,
they were stretched so tight&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Merciful Saints! And I'm so fond of
truffles too! Hurry there, Garrigou, hand me
my surplice. And what else did you see in
the kitchen besides the turkeys?"</p>

<p>"Oh, all sorts of good things. Ever since
twelve o'clock we have been plucking pheasants,
hoopoes, hazel-hens, and heath-cocks. From the
pond they brought in eels, gold-fish, trouts,
and&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span></p>

<p>"About how big were the trouts, Garrigou?"</p>

<p>"Oh, about so big, my reverend; simply
enormous&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Holy Fathers! I can just see them. Did
you put the wine in the vases?"</p>

<p>"Yes, my reverend, I filled them; but
mercy! that isn't anything like the wine you'll
have later, after midnight Mass. You ought to
see the dining-hall at the castle,&mdash;all the decanters
glittering with the many-colored wines, and
the silver, the plate, the chased centre-pieces,
the flowers, the candelabrum; I don't suppose
there has ever been such a Christmas supper!
The Lord Marquis has invited all the lords of
the neighboring estates. There will be over
forty at the table, leaving out the bailiff and the
notary. Ah, my reverend, you are very lucky
to be invited! The smell of the truffles haunts
me now, simply from having sniffed at those turkeys,&mdash;meuh!"</p>

<p>"Come, come, my child, let us beware of
the sin of greediness,&mdash;particularly on the night
of the Nativity. Hurry off now and light the
tapers, and ring the first call for Mass; it will
soon be midnight, and we can't afford to lose
time."</p>

<p>This conversation occurred one Christmas
night in the year of our Lord sixteen hundred
and something, between the reverend Dom Bala<span
class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>guère,
formerly prior of the Barnabites, and present
chaplain of the Sires of Trinquelague, and
his little clerk, or rather what he believed to be
his little clerk Garrigou,&mdash;for let me tell you that
the Devil on that particular night had assumed
the round face and uncertain features of the
young sacristan, the better to lead the reverend
father into temptation and make him commit a
great sin of greediness. So while the would-be
Garrigou (hem! hem!) rang out the chimes
with all his might from the seigniorial chapel, the
reverend father was slipping on his chasuble in
the little vestry; and as his imagination was
somewhat excited by Garrigou's gastronomic
accounts, he repeated mechanically as he got
into his vestments,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Two roast turkeys, gold-fish, trouts about
so big!"</p>

<p>Without, the night wind blew, and scattered
the music of the bells. Gradually lights began
to pierce the gloom along the roads of Mount
Ventoux, on whose summit the old towers of
Trinquelague reared their mighty heads. The
neighboring farmers and their families were on
their way to the castle to hear midnight Mass.
They climbed the mountain singing gayly, in little
groups of five or six,&mdash;the father ahead carrying
the lantern, the women following, wrapped
in great dark cloaks under which the children<span
class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
snuggled to keep warm. In spite of the cold
and the advanced hour of the night, all these
good people walked along merrily, cheered by
the thought that a great supper was awaiting
them as usual, below, in the castle kitchens, after
Mass. Every now and then, on the rough declivity
some fine lord's coach, preceded by torch-bearers,
showed its glimmering window-panes in
the moonlight; or then a mule trotted along
shaking its bells; or again, by the light of
their lanterns wrapped in mist, the farmers recognized
their bailiff and hailed him as they
passed.</p>

<p>"Good-night, good-night, Master Arnoton!"</p>

<p>"Good-night; good-night, my children!"</p>

<p>It was a clear night; the stars seemed brightened
by the cold; the wind was nipping; and a
fine sleet powdered all these cloaks without wetting
them, just in order to preserve the tradition
that requires Christmas to be white with snow.</p>

<p>On the very crest of the mountain the castle
appeared like a goal, with its huge mass of towers
and gables, the chapel steeple rising straight
into the blue-black sky, while a thousand little
lights moved rapidly hither and thither, blinking
at all the windows, and looking, against the intense
black of the building, like the tiny sparks
that glimmer in a pile of burnt paper.</p>

<p>After passing the drawbridge and the postern,<span
class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
in order to reach the chapel, one had to cross the
first court, crowded with coaches, footmen, sedan-chairs,
and bright with the flame of torches and
the glare from the kitchens. One could hear the
clicking of the spits, the rattling of pots, the
tinkling of crystal and silver, as they were laid out
for the banquet; and above it all floated a warm
vapor smelling of roasted meats and the pungent
herbs of complicated sauces, which made the
farmers, as well as the chaplain, the bailiff, and
everybody say,&mdash;</p>

<p>"What a good supper we shall have after
Mass!"</p>


<h3>II.</h3>

<p>Ding, ling, ling! Ding, ling, ling!</p>

<p>Midnight Mass has begun. In the chapel of
the castle, which is a miniature cathedral, with
intercrossed arches and oaken wainscoting up
to the ceiling, all the tapestries are hung, all
the tapers lighted. What a crowd of people,
and what sumptuous costumes! Here, in one of
the carven stalls that surround the choir, sits the
Sire of Trinquelague, clad in salmon-colored silk,
and around him all the noble lords, his guests.
Opposite them, on velvet fall-stools, kneel the
old dowager Marchioness, in a gown of flame-colored
brocade, and the young lady of Trinquelague,
wearing on her pretty head a great tower<span
class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
of lace puffed and quilled according to the latest
fashion at the court of France. Farther down
the aisle, all dressed in black, with vast pointed
wigs and cleanly shaven chins, sit Thomas Arnoton
the bailiff, and the notary, Master Ambroy,
two sombre spots amid the high colors of silks
and brocaded damasks. Then come the fat
major-domos, the pages, outriders, the stewards,
Dame Barbe with her great bunch of keys dangling
from her side on a ring of fine silver. On
the benches in the rear is the lower service,&mdash;butlers,
maids, the farmers and their families.
And last of all, far back against the doors, which
they discreetly open and close, come the cooks,
between two sauces, to catch a little whiff of the
Mass, bringing with them into the bedecked
church, warm with the light of so many tapers,
odoriferous suggestions of the Christmas supper.</p>

<p>Can it be the sight of these crisp white caps
that diverts the reverend father's attention? Or
is it not rather Garrigou's bell?&mdash;that fiendish
little bell that tinkles away at the foot of the
altar with such infernal haste, and seems to be
saying,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Come, come, let us hurry! The sooner we
despatch the service, the sooner we go to
supper."</p>

<p>The fact of the matter is that at every peal
from this little devil of a bell, the chaplain for<span
class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>gets
his Mass and allows his mind to wander to
the Christmas supper. He evokes visions of
busy kitchens, with ovens glowing like furnaces,
warm vapors rising from under tin lids, and
through these vapors, two superb turkeys,
stuffed, crammed, mottled with truffles. Or then
again, he sees long files of little pages carrying
great dishes wrapped in their tempting fumes,
and with them he is about to enter the dining-hall.
What ecstasy! Here stands the immense
table, laden and dazzling with peacocks dressed
in their feathers, pheasants spreading their
bronzed wings, ruby-colored decanters, pyramids
of luscious fruit amid the foliage, and those
wonderful fish that Garrigou spoke of (Garrigou,
forsooth!) reclining on a bed of fennel, their
pearly scales looking as if they were just from
the pond, and a bunch of pungent herbs in their
monster-like nostrils. This beatific vision is so
vivid that Dom Balaguère actually fancies that
the glorious dishes are being served before him,
on the very embroideries of the altar-cloth, and
instead of saying <i>Dominus vobiscum</i>, he catches
himself saying the <i>Benedicite</i>.</p>

<p>With the exception of these slight mistakes
the worthy man rattled off the service conscientiously,
without skipping a line, or omitting a
genuflection, and all went well to the end of the
first Mass. For you must know that on Christ<span
class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>mas
the same officiating priest is obliged to say
three Masses consecutively.</p>

<p>"So much for one!" thought the chaplain,
with a sigh of relief; and without losing a second,
he motioned his clerk, or him whom he believed
to be his clerk, and&mdash;</p>

<p>Ding, ling, ling! Ding, ling, ling!</p>

<p>The second Mass has begun&mdash;and with it Dom
Balaguère's sin. "Come, let us hurry!" says
Garrigou's bell, in a shrill, devilish little voice, at
the mere sound of which the unfortunate priest
pounces upon the missal and devours its pages
with all the avidity of his over-excited brain.
He kneels and rises frantically, barely sketches
the sign of the cross and the genuflections, and
shortens all of his gestures in order to get through
sooner. He scarcely extends his arms at the
Gospel, or strikes his breast at the <i>Confiteor</i>.
Between him and his little clerk it is hard to tell
who mumbles the faster. The words, half uttered
between their teeth,&mdash;for it would take
them too long to open their lips every time,&mdash;die
out into unintelligible murmurs,&mdash;</p>

<p>Oremus&mdash;ps&mdash;ps&mdash;ps&mdash;</p>

<p>Meâ culpa&mdash;pâ&mdash;pâ&mdash;</p>

<p>Like hurried vintagers crushing the grapes in
the mash-tuns, they both splashed about in the
Latin of the service, spattering it in every
direction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span></p>

<p>"Dom&mdash;scum!" says Balaguère.</p>

<p>"Stutuo!" responds Garrigou, while the infernal
little bell jingles in their ears like the sleigh-bells
that are put on stage-horses to hasten their
speed. You may well imagine that at such a
rate a Low Mass is soon rattled off.</p>

<p>"So much for the second," says the panting
chaplain, with scarlet face, in a full perspiration;
and without taking time to breathe, he goes
tumbling down the altar steps, and&mdash;</p>

<p>Ding, ling, ling! Ding, ling, ling!</p>

<p>The third Mass is under way. Only a few minutes
stand between them and the supper. But
alas! as the time approaches, Dom Balaguère's
fever of impatience and greediness increases.
His vision grows more and more vivid; the
fish, the roasted turkeys, are there before him;
he touches them; he&mdash;great Heavens!&mdash;he
breathes the perfume of the wines and the
savory fumes of the dishes, and the frantic little
bell calls out to him,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Hurry, hurry! Faster, faster!"</p>

<p>But how on earth can he go faster? His lips
barely move; he has given up enunciating altogether,&mdash;unless,
forsooth, he chooses to cheat
the Lord, and swindle him out of his Mass.
And that is just what he is doing, the wretched
man! Yielding first to one temptation, then another,
he skips one verse, then two; then the<span
class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
Epistle being very long, he omits part of it, skims
over the Gospel, passes the Creed unnoticed,
skips the <i>Pater</i>, hails the preface from afar, and
thus with a skip and a jump plunges into eternal
damnation, followed by that infamous Garrigou
(<i>Vade retro, Satanas!</i>), who seconds him with
marvellous sympathy, upholds his chasuble, turns
the pages two at a time, jostles the lectern, and
upsets the vases, while the little bell rings constantly,
ever faster and louder.</p>

<p>It would be impossible to describe the bewildered
expression of the congregation. Compelled
to follow, mimicking the priest, through
this Mass, of which they can make neither head
nor tail, some stand while others kneel, some
sit while others stand; and all the phases of this
singular service are jumbled together along the
benches in the greatest confusion of varied postures.
The Christmas star on the celestial road,
journeying toward the little manger yonder,
grows pale at the very thought.</p>

<p>"The abbé reads too fast; it is impossible to
follow him," whispers the old dowager Marchioness,
whose voluminous head-dress shakes
wildly. Master Arnoton, with his great steel
spectacles on his nose, loses his place every
minute and fingers his Prayer-Book nervously.
Still, at heart all these good people, whose
minds are equally bent upon the Christmas sup<span
class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>per,
are not at all disturbed at the idea of following
Mass at such breakneck speed; and when
Dom Balaguère, facing them radiantly, exclaims
in a thundering voice, "Ite missa est," the response,
"Deo gracias," is so unanimous, joyous,
and spirited, that any one might take it for the
first toast of the supper.</p>


<h3>III.</h3>

<p>Five minutes later the assembled lords, and
the chaplain among them, had taken their seats
in the great hall. The castle, brilliantly illumined,
echoed with songs and laughter; and the venerable
Dom Balaguère drove his fork resolutely
into a capon's wing, drowning the remorse for
his sin in the savory juice of meats and the
soothing draughts of old wine. He ate and
drank so heartily, the dear good man, that he
died of a spasm that very night, without even
having had time to repent. By morning he
reached heaven, where the thrills of the past
night's ecstasies lingered still in the air, and I
leave you to imagine how he was received.</p>

<p>"Get thee gone, thou wretched Christian!"
said Saint Peter; "thy sin is great enough to
wipe out the virtues of a lifetime! Ah, so
thou wouldst swindle us out of a Mass! Very
well, then, three hundred Masses shalt thou say,<span
class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
nor shalt thou enter into Paradise until three
hundred Christmas Masses have been celebrated
in thine own chapel, and in the presence of all
those who sinned with thee and through thee."</p>

<p>And this is the true legend of Dom Balaguère,
as it is told in the land of the olive-tree. The
castle of Trinquelague has long ceased to exist;
but the chapel stands erect on the crest of
Mount Ventoux, in a clump of evergreen oaks.
The wind sways its unhinged door; the grass
grows over the threshold; there are nests in the
angles of the altar, and on the sills of the high
ogive windows, whose jewelled panes have long
since disappeared. Still, it seems that every
year at Christmas supernatural, mysterious lights
hover among the ruins; and on their way to midnight
Mass and the Christmas supper, the peasants
see this spectre of a chapel lighted by
invisible tapers, which burn in the open air,
even in the wind and under the snow. You may
laugh if you will, but a wine-dresser of the district,
named Garrigue, a descendant of Garrigou,
no doubt, has often told me that on one
particular Christmas night, being somewhat in
liquor, he had lost his way on the mountain
somewhere near Trinquelague, and this is what
he saw: until eleven o'clock nothing. Everything
was silent and dark. Suddenly at midnight
the chimes rang out from the old steeple,<span
class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>&mdash;strange,
uncanny chimes, that seemed to be
ringing a thousand miles away. Soon lights
began to tremble along the road, and vague
shadows moved about. Under the portal of
the chapel there were sounds of footsteps and
muffled voices:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Good-night, Master Arnoton!"</p>

<p>"Good-night, good-night, my children!"</p>

<p>When they had all gone in, my wine-dresser,
who was a courageous fellow, crawled up to the
door and there beheld a most marvellous spectacle.
All these good shadows sat around the
choir in the ruined nave just as though the
benches were still there. There were fine ladies
in brocades and lace head-dresses, lords gayly
bedizened, peasants in flowered coats like those
our grandfathers wore, all of them dusty, faded,
weary. Every now and then, some night-bird,
an habitual lodger in the chapel, awakened by
all these lights, began to flutter about the tapers,
whose flames rose erect and vague as though
they were burning behind a strip of gauze. Garrigue
was particularly amused at a gentleman
with great steel spectacles, who constantly shook
his huge black wig, upon which perched one of
these birds with entangled claws and beating
wings.</p>

<p>A little old man with a childlike figure knelt
in the centre of the choir and frantically shook a<span
class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
tiny bell which had lost its voice, while a priest
clad in old-gold vestments moved hither and
thither before the altar repeating orisons of which
not a syllable could be heard.</p>

<p>Who could this have been but Dom Balaguère,
saying his third Low Mass?</p>

many years ago,
for I was then only
seven, my father came
to me in the twilight of
a winter's day, when the
three <i>Ave Marias</i> had
been repeated to the
sound of the church-bells,
and said solemnly,
"You need not go to
bed with the chickens
to-night, Pedro; you are a big boy now, and you
ought to have supper with your parents and
your older brothers. This is Christmas Eve."</p>

<p>I shall never forget the delight with which I
heard these words. I was not going to bed<span

until late! I cast a glance of commiseration
and contempt upon my younger brothers, and
instantly fell to composing a description, to be
delivered at school on my return after Twelfth
Night, of this my first adventure, my first lark,
the first dissipation of my life.</p>

<p>It was already
<span class="replace" id="tn_9"

href="#FNanchor_1">[1]</a></span> A certain hour of the evening,
when the ringing of
bells admonishes the faithful to pray for the souls in
purgatory.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>Our village! Ninety leagues from Madrid, a
thousand leagues from the world, nestling in a
fold of the Sierra Nevada! I can almost fancy
I see you, brothers, father, and mother!</p>

<p>A huge oak log whistled and crackled in the
fireplace. We all sat together under the vault
of the chimney. My two grandmothers, who
spent that night with us, presiding over the
household ceremonies, occupied the corner seats;
my father and mother sat next to them, the rest
of the place being occupied by the children and
servants; for on such an occasion we all represented
the home, and it seemed fitting that
one fire should warm us all. I remember, however,
that our men remained standing, and that<span
class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
our maids squatted or knelt. Their respectful
humility forbade their occupying a chair. The
cats slept in the centre of the circle, their tails
turned to the fire. An occasional snowflake
came fluttering down the chimney,&mdash;that elfin
road,&mdash;and the wind moaned in the distance
and spoke to us of the absent, the poor, the
wayfarers. My father and my eldest sister
played on the harp, and I accompanied them,
to their distress, on a drum which I had contrived
that very evening out of a broken water-jug.</p>

<p>Do you know the song of the Aguinaldos,
which is sung in the villages that lie east of the
Mulhacem? Well, that was the music that
constituted the concert. The maid-servants
took it upon themselves to render the vocal
parts, and they sang couplets to this effect:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry">
  <p>"To-night is Christmas eve;</p>
  <p class="i1">To-morrow is Christmas day.</p>
  <p>Maria, fetch the jug of wine;</p>
  <p class="i1">Let's be merry while we may."</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">And all was happiness and merry-making.
Rusks, butter-cakes, pastes of nuts and honey,
sweetmeats made by the nuns, rosoli, and
cherry brandy were freely passed around.
There was much talk of going to midnight
Mass, to the Nativity play at dawn, to see the
Bethlehem manger which we boys had con<span
class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>structed
in the tower, and also of making sherbet
out of the snow that carpeted the court.</p>

<p>Suddenly in the midst of all this merriment
I was struck by the deep meaning of these
words, sung by my paternal grandmother:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry">
  <p class="i1">"Christmas comes,</p>
  <p class="i1">Christmas goes;</p>
  <p>But soon we all shall be of those</p>
  <p class="i1">Who come back&mdash;never!"</p>
</div>

<p>In spite of my tender age this couplet chilled
my heart. All the melancholy horizons of life
seemed to have been unfolded before me in a
flash. It was a burst of intuition, unnatural at
my age; it was a miraculous prescience, the
herald of the ineffable tedium of poetry; it was
my first inspiration. I saw and understood at
a glance, with marvellous lucidity, the inevitable
fate of the three generations present. It occurred
to me that my grandparents, my parents,
and my brothers were like a marching army
whose vanguard was stepping into the grave,
while the rearguard had not yet left the cradle;
and these three generations represented a century;
and all past centuries had been alike, and
ours would disappear as they had done, and so
would the centuries unborn.</p>

<div class="poetry">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span></p>

<p class="noindent">Such is the implacable monotony of time, the
pendulum oscillating in space, the indifferent
repetition of events, in contrast with the brevity
of our pilgrimage in this world.</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">Horrible thought! Cruel sentence, the definite
meaning of which was like a summons to me,&mdash;death
beckoning me from the shadows of
the future. Before my imagination a thousand
Christmas Eves filed by, a thousand hearths
were extinguished, a thousand families that had
supped together ceased to exist,&mdash;other children,
other joys, other songs, lost forever; the
loves of my grandparents, their antiquated mode
of dress, their remote youth, the memories
thereof that crowded upon them; my parents'
childhood, the first Christmas celebration in our
home, all the happiness that had preceded me!
Then I could imagine, I could foresee, a thousand
more Christmas Eves recurring periodically
and robbing us of our life and hope,&mdash;future
joys in which we should not all take part together,
my brothers scattered over the earth, my
parents naturally dying before us, the twentieth
century following upon the nineteenth! The
live coals turned to ashes,&mdash;my vanished youth,
my old age, my grave, my posthumous memory,<span
class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
then the complete oblivion of me, the indifference,
the ingratitude of my grandchildren,
living of my blood, and who would laugh and
enjoy while the worms profaned the skull in
which these very thoughts were now conceived.</p>

<p>The tears gushed from my eyes. I was asked
why I was crying, and as I did not know or at
least could not have defined the reason even to
myself, my father concluded that I was sleepy,
and I was accordingly sent to bed. Here was
another motive for weeping, and so it happened
that my first philosophical tears and my last
childish ones were mingled. That night of insomnia
which I spent listening to the joyous
sounds of a celebration from which I had been
excluded for being too much of a child, as my
parents believed then,&mdash;or too much of a man,
as I realize now,&mdash;was perhaps the bitterest of
my life.</p>

<p>I must have fallen asleep at last, however, for
I cannot remember whether the projects of going
to midnight Mass, the Nativity play, and
making sherbet out of the snow in the court fell
through or not.</p>


<h3>III.</h3>

<p>Where is my childhood?</p>

<p>I feel as though I had just been relating a
dream.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span></p>

<p>The world is wide, after all! My paternal
grandmother, the one who sang the couplet,
died a long time ago. On the other hand, my
brothers have married and have children. My
father's harp, unstrung and broken, has been
thrown among the cast-off furniture. It has
been many a Christmas Eve since I had supper
at home. My village has disappeared from the
ocean of my life like the islet which the mariner
leaves behind him.</p>

<p>I am no longer the same Pedro, the child,
that focus of ignorance, curiosity, and anguish
trembling on the threshold of life. I am nothing
short of a man, an inhabitant of Madrid,
comfortably settled in life, proud of my independence
as a bachelor, a novelist, and a volunteer
in the great orphanage of the capital, with
whiskers, debts, and loves.</p>

<p>When I compare myself now, my perfect
freedom, my broad life, the immense scene of my
operations, my early experience, standing as I
do revealed, tuned like a grand piano on the
night of a concert; when I compare myself with
all my boldness, my ambitions, my contempts,
with the little chap that played the drum fifteen
years ago on Christmas Eve in a remote corner
of Andalusia,&mdash;I smile, I even laugh aloud,
with the feeling that it befits me, while my
lonely heart sheds pure tears of infinite melan<span
class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>choly,
which it carefully hides from view. Holy
tears! May Providence frank you to the home
where my father is growing old!</p>


<h3>IV.</h3>

<p>Well, what shall it be?&mdash;for, as the boys sing in
the streets,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry">
  <p>"Christmas Eve! Christmas Eve!</p>
  <p>This is surely no night for sleep!"</p>
</div>

<p>Where shall I spend the evening? Fortunately
I can choose; let me see.</p>

<p>This is the 24th of December, 1855. We are
in Madrid. We know the waiters of all the
cafés by name. We are hand in glove with the
most applauded poets of the day, the demi-gods
of provincial amateurs. We frequent theatres
and see plays from the inside, as it were.
The great actors and singers shake our hand
behind the scenes. We penetrate into the
editor's rooms and are initiated in the alchemy
which produces newspapers. We have seen the
type-setter's fingers stained with the lead of
words, and the fingers of the author stained with
the ink of thoughts. We have free access to
one of the tribunes of Congress, credit at the
hotels; there are social gatherings that appreciate
us, and tailors that endure us.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span></p>

<p>We are happy! Our youthful ambition is
satisfied. We can enjoy this night. We have
conquered the world. Madrid is ours. Madrid
is our home. A cheer for Madrid! And you,
provincial youths, who at nightfall on an
autumn day, sad and lonely, unearth and air
your impotent longing for the capital,&mdash;you who
feel yourselves to be poets, musicians, painters,
orators, who despise your village, who will not
speak to your parents, who weep with ambition
and dream of suicide,&mdash;burst with envy, all of
you, as we are now bursting with pleasure.</p>


<h3>V.</h3>

<p>Two hours have passed. It is nine o'clock.
I have money; where shall I take supper?
My friends, more fortunate than I, will smother
their loneliness in the clamor of an orgy.
"Night is of wine," they said to me only a few
moments ago; but I would not be of them.
It has been some time now since I crossed this
red sea of youth dry-footed.</p>

<p>"Night is of tears," I said to them.</p>

<p>Those who compose our social gatherings are
at the theatre. The people of Madrid celebrate
the Nativity of our Lord by listening to the
ranting of actors.</p>

<p>A few homes in which I am almost a stranger<span
class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
have offered me alms out of their domestic
warmth in the form of an invitation to dinner,&mdash;for
the old-fashioned supper has gone out of
style. But I would not accept. That is not
what I want. What I long for is the Paschal
feast, the Christmas Eve supper, my home, my
relatives, my traditions, my memories, the
former joys of my soul, the religion that was
taught me when I was a child.</p>


<h3>VI.</h3>

<p>Ah, Madrid is an inn. On a night like this
we come to know what Madrid is. Our capital
is a floating population, heterogeneous, exotic,
which can only be compared to the population
of a free port, of a jail, of an insane asylum.
Travellers journeying toward a future, to the
fantastic kingdom of ambition, halt here as well
as those who are journeying back from misery,
from crime.</p>

<p>Beauty comes here to marry, or to sell herself,
the landed proprietor to squander his wealth,
the literati for glory, the deputy to become a
minister, the worthless man for a government
office. The savant, the inventor, the comedian,
the giant, the dwarf, the man with an anomaly
in his soul or in his body, the monster with
seven arms and three noses as well as the phi<span
class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>losopher
with double sight, the charlatan, the
reformer, the man who creates melodies, and
the man who counterfeits bank-notes,&mdash;all spend
some period of their life in the great inn.
Those who attain notoriety, those who find a
purchaser, those who have grown rich at the
expense of themselves, become in time the innkeepers,
the landlords, the masters of Madrid,
and forget the land of their birth. But we, the
wayfarers, the lodgers,&mdash;we realize to-night that
Madrid means exile, that Madrid is a bivouac, a
prison, a purgatory. For the first time in the
year we feel that neither the café, the theatre, the
casino, nor the hotel is our house. More than
that, we realize that our house is not our home.</p>


<h3>VII.</h3>

<p>The home&mdash;that sacred abode of the patriarch,
of the Roman citizen, of the feudal lord, of
the very Arab; the holy arch of the Penates,
temple of hospitality, and altar of the family&mdash;has
completely disappeared in our great modern
centres. The home survives in the provinces
alone. There our house is our own. In Madrid
it is generally the landlord's. In the provinces
our house shelters us for twenty, thirty,
forty years at least. In Madrid one moves every
month, or at least every year. Our home has a<span
class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
physiognomy of its own, which never varies, ever
kindly and sympathetic. It grows old with us;
it bears the impress of our lives; it preserves our
footprints. In Madrid the exterior changes
every leap year; the apartments are arrayed in
new garments; that furniture is sold which our
contact had consecrated. At home the whole
edifice is ours: the grassy court, the poultry-yard
filled with chickens, the high, cheery terraces,
the deep well,&mdash;the children's terror,&mdash;the
monumental tower, the broad cool, vine-covered
summer-house. Here we occupy a
half-flat, paper-lined, and divided into mean
apartments, with no view of the sky, no sun, no
air. There we have that neighborly affection,
something between friendship and relationship,
which binds together all the families of one
street. Here the man who moves about noisily
above our heads is unknown to us, neither do
we know the man who dies beyond the partition
of our alcove, and whose death-rattle disturbs
our sleep. Our provincial home is a cluster of
memories, of local attachments: here the room
in which we were born, there the room where
our brother died; here the empty hall in which
we played as children, there the study in which
we wrote our first verses. On the chapter of a
column, in the trough of an old ceiling, swallows
have built their nests, and every year the faithful<span
class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
couple fly over from Africa to hatch a new brood.
In Madrid all this is unknown. And the hearth,
that consecrated stone, cold in summer, cold
in our absence, but warm and friendly during
the happy winter evenings when all the children
are brought together and grouped about the old
people,&mdash;for the colleges have their vacations,
the married daughters bring their little ones
home on a visit, and the absent ones, the prodigal
sons, come back to the heart of the family,&mdash;where,
tell me, where is this hearth in the houses
of the capital? Can we call a French mantel-piece,
made of marble, bronze, and iron, a hearth,
that which one can buy at a store, at wholesale
or retail, and can even hire, if need be? The
French mantel-piece is the symbol of home in a
great city. People of Madrid, that is your
hearth,&mdash;a hearth subject to the changes of
fashion, a hearth which is sold when it is old,
which can be moved from room to room, from
street to street, and which can even be pawned
in an emergency.</p>


<h3>VIII.</h3>

<p>I wandered through a street. Far above my
head, from a high story, my grandmother's prophetic
couplet floated down to me amid the
shock of glasses, the rattle of dishes, and the
merry laughter of girls.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry">
  <p class="i1">"Christmas comes,</p>
  <p class="i1">Christmas goes;</p>
  <p>But soon we all shall be of those</p>
  <p class="i1">Who come back&mdash;never!"</p>
</div>

<p>"Here," thought I, "is a home, a hearth,
with almond soup and a gilt-head, which I
could buy for four dollars!" Just then a woman
came up to me, begging. She had two children,
one in her arms wrapped in her ravelled
shawl, the other clinging to her hand. Both
were crying; I thought the mother was crying
too.</p>


<h3>IX.</h3>

<p>I do not know how I happen to be in this
café. The clock strikes midnight, the hour
when the Christ was born. I am here, alone, in
a boisterous crowd. I have fallen to analyzing
my life since I left my father's roof, and for the
first time I am horror-stricken at the painful
struggle of the poet in Madrid,&mdash;a struggle in
which so much affection, so much peace, is sacrificed
to a vain ambition.</p>

<p>I have watched the bards of the nineteenth
century writing the local; I have watched the
Muse, scissors in hand, making clippings; I have
seen men who in other ages would have written
a national epic busily patching up editorials to rehabilitate
a party and earn fifty dollars a month.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span></p>

<p>Poor children of God! Poor poets! Antonio
Trueba, to whom I dedicate this article,
says,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I have found so many thorns on my journey
that my heart aches, my soul aches!"</p>

<p>And so much for my present Christmas Eve!</p>

<p>Then I travel back, in thought, through the
bygone years. I am surely missed at home to-night;
and my mother shivers when the wind
moans in the chimney, as though those moans
were my dying sighs. And she says to the
neighbors, "In such a year, when he was with
us," or, "I wonder where he is now!"</p>

<p>Ah, I cannot bear this! I wave you a farewell
from my soul, dear ones! I am ambitious;
I am an ingrate, a bad brother, a bad son!
How can I explain it? A supernatural force
leads me on, whispering, "Thou shalt be!"
The voice of damnation that spoke to me in my
very cradle. And what, pray, am I to be, poor
wretch that I am?</p>

<div class="poetry">
  <p>"Soon we all shall be of those</p>
  <p class="i1">Who come back&mdash;never!"</p>
</div>

<p>Ah, I do not want to go! I shall not go! I
have struggled too hard to fail. I shall return.
I will triumph in life and in death. Is there to
be no compensation for the infinite anguish of
my soul?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span></p>


<h3>X.</h3>

<p>It is very late, and that couplet of the dead
still rings in my brain,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry">
  <p class="i1">"Christmas comes,</p>
  <p class="i1">Christmas goes;</p>
  <p>But soon we all shall be of those</p>
  <p class="i1">Who come back&mdash;never!"</p>
</div>

<p>"Yes, yes; other Christmas Eves will come,"
thought I, as a child; and I dreamed of the future
and built castles in the air. I saw myself the
centre of a family, as yet unborn, in the second
twilight of life when the flowers of love come to
fruit. That storm of love and tears which wrecks
me now was passed; my head was at rest in the
lap of patience, crowned with the melancholy
flowers of the last, true affections. I was a husband,
a father, the support of a home, of a
family.</p>

<p>The flame of an unknown hearth sparkled in
the distance, and in its vacillating light I saw
strange beings that made me throb with pride;
they were my sons. Then I wept, and I closed
my eyes to prolong the vision of that reddish
light and the prophetic apparition of the unborn.
The grave was near; my locks were gray. But
what of that? Would not half of my life remain
in these children of love? Would not half of<span
class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
my soul remain with their mother? In vain did
I try to recognize this wife, who was to share the
twilight of my life. This future companion whom
God holds for me sat with her back to me. I
could not see her face. I looked for the reflection
of her features in the faces of my sons, but
the light from the hearth began to fail.</p>

<p>When it was out I still saw her, because I felt
the warmth of her in my soul. I murmured:</p>

<div class="poetry">
  <p class="i1">"Christmas comes,</p>
  <p class="i1">Christmas&mdash;"</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">And I was asleep, perhaps dead.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">It</span>
was Christmas Eve, and
a devilishly cold night.
The snow fell in great
flakes, which the wind
beat against the window-panes.
The distant
chimes reached us, confused
and faint through
the heavy, cottony atmosphere. The passers-by,
muffled in their cloaks, glided along hurriedly,
brushing by the walls of the houses, bending
their heads before the wind. Wrapped in my
dressing-gown, I smiled as I drummed on the
window-pane, smiled at the passers-by, at the
north wind and the snow, with the smile of a
happy man who is in a warm room with his feet
in a pair of flannel-lined slippers which sink into
a thick, soft carpet.</p>

<p>My wife sat in a corner of the hearth with a
great piece of cloth before her which she cut
and trimmed off; and every now and then she<span
class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
raised her eyes, which met mine. A new book
lay on the mantel-piece awaiting me, and a log in
the fireplace whistled as it spit out those little
blue flames which tempt one to poke it.</p>

<p>"There is nothing so stupid as a man trudging
along in the snow. Is there?" said I.</p>

<p>"Sh-h-h!" said my wife, laying down her
scissors. Then she stroked her chin thoughtfully
with her tapering pink fingers, slightly
plump at the extremities, and looked over very
carefully the pieces she had just cut out.</p>

<p>"I say that it is absurd to go out into the
cold when it is so easy to stay at home by the
fire."</p>

<p>"Sh-h-h!"</p>

<p>"What the deuce are you doing that is so
important?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I am cutting out a pair of suspenders
for you;" and she resumed her task. Her hair
was coiled a little higher than usual; and where I
stood, behind her, I could just see, as she leaned
over her work, the nape of her neck, white and
velvety. Innumerable soft little locks curled
there gracefully, and this pretty down reminded
me of those ripe peaches into which we drive
our teeth greedily. I leaned nearer to see and&mdash;kissed
my wife on the neck.</p>

<p>"Monsieur!" exclaimed Louise, turning suddenly
around.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span></p>

<p>"Madame!" and we both burst into a laugh.</p>

<p>"Come, come; on Christmas Eve!"</p>

<p>"Monsieur apologizes?"</p>

<p>"Madame complains?"</p>

<p>"Yes; Madame complains. Madame complains
of your not being more moved, more
thrilled by the spirit of Christmas. The ding-ding-dong
from the bells of Notre Dame
awakens no emotion in you; and when the magic-lantern
went by under your very window, you
were perfectly unmoved, utterly indifferent. I
watched you attentively, though I pretended to
work."</p>

<p>"Unmoved? Indifferent? I? When the
magic lantern went by! Ah, my dear! you
judge me very severely, and really&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes; laugh if you will. It is nevertheless
true that the pretty memories of your
childhood are lost."</p>

<p>"Come, my pet, would you like me to stand
my boots in the fireplace to-night before I go to
bed? Would you like me to stop the magic-lantern
man and go and get him a sheet and a
candle-end, as my mother used to do? I can
almost see her as she handed him the sheet.
'Be careful you don't tear it, now,' she would
say; and we all clapped our hands in the mysterious
obscurity. I remember all those joys,
dear; but, you see, so many things have hap<span
class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>pened
since. Other pleasures have obliterated
those."</p>

<p>"Yes, I understand,&mdash;the pleasures of your
bachelorhood! Come, now, I am sure this is
the first Christmas Eve that has ever found you
by your own fireside, in your dressing-gown and
without a supper, because you always had supper;
that goes without saying&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Why, I don't know&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes; I wager you always had a supper."</p>

<p>"Well, perhaps I did, once or twice, although
I scarcely remember; I may have had supper
with a few old friends. And what did it all
amount to? Two pennies' worth of chestnuts
and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And a glass of sugar and water."</p>

<p>"Well, just about. Oh, it was nothing much,
I can assure you! It sounds great at a distance.
We talked awhile, and then we went
to bed."</p>

<p>"And he says all that with the straightest
face! You have never breathed a word of these
simple pleasures to me."</p>

<p>"But, my dear, what I tell you is the absolute
truth. I remember once, however, at Ernest's,
when I was in rather high spirits, we had a little
music afterwards&mdash;Will you push me that log?
Well, never mind; it is almost midnight, and
time for all reasonable people to&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span></p>

<p>(Louise, rising and throwing her arms around
me.) "Well, I don't choose to be reasonable,
and I mean to eclipse the memory of those
penny chestnuts and all that sugar and water!"
(Pushing me hastily into my study, and locking
the door.)</p>

<p>"What the deuce is the matter with you, my
dear?" I cried from the other side of the
partition.</p>

<p>"Give me ten minutes, no more. Your
paper is on the mantel-piece; you have not seen
it to-night. You will find the matches in the
corner."</p>

<p>Then I heard the rattle of china, the rustle of
silky stuffs. Could my wife have gone crazy?
At the end of about ten minutes she unlocked
the door.</p>

<p>"Don't scold me for shutting you out," said
she, embracing me. "Look at me. Have I
not made myself beautiful? See! My hair
just as you like it, high, and my neck uncovered.
But my poor neck is so extremely shy that it
never could have displayed itself in the broad
light, if I had not encouraged it a little by
wearing a low-necked gown. After all, it is only
right to be in full-dress uniform at a supper with
the authority."</p>

<p>"What supper?"</p>

<p>"Why, our supper. My supper with you, of<span
class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
course. Don't you see my illumination and the
table covered with flowers and good things to
eat? I had it all ready in the alcove; but, you see,
to push the table before the fire and make something
of a toilet, I had to be alone. I have a
big drop of old Chambertin for you. Come,
Monsieur, come to supper; I am as hungry as a
bear! May I offer you this chicken-wing?"</p>

<p>"This is a charming idea of yours, my love,
but I really feel ashamed of myself,&mdash;in my
dressing-gown."</p>

<p>"Take it off, sir, if you are uncomfortable,
but do not leave me with this chicken-wing on
my hands. Wait a minute; I want to wait upon
you myself." And rising, she swung her napkin
over her arm and pulled up her sleeve to her
elbow. "Isn't that the way the waiters do at
the restaurants, tell me?"</p>

<p>"Exactly. But stop a moment, waiter; will
you permit me to kiss your hand?"</p>

<p>"I haven't time," she said, smiling, and she
drove the corkscrew bravely into the neck of a
bottle. "Chambertin!&mdash;a pretty name. And,
besides, do you remember, before we were married&mdash;<i>sapristi</i>,
what a hard cork!&mdash;you told
me you liked it on account of a play by Alfred
de Musset?&mdash;which you never gave me to
read, by the way. Do you see those little Bohemian
glass tumblers that I bought especially for<span
class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
to-night? We will drink each other's health in
them."</p>

<p>"And his too, eh?"</p>

<p>"The heir's, you mean? Poor little love of
an heir, I should think so! Then I shall hide
the two glasses and bring them out again this
day next year, eh, dear? They will be the
Christmas-supper glasses, and we will have
supper every year before the hearth, you and I
alone, until our very old, old age."</p>

<p>"Yes; but when we shall have lost all our
teeth&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Never mind; we shall have nice little soups,
and it will none the less be very sweet. Another
piece for me, please, with a little jelly,
thank you."</p>

<p>As she held out her plate to me, I caught a
glimpse of her arm, the pretty contours of which
disappeared in the lace.</p>

<p>"What are you looking up my sleeve for instead
of eating?"</p>

<p>"I am looking at your arm, dear. You are
exquisitely pretty to-night; do you know it?
Your hair is wonderfully becoming, and that
gown&mdash;I had never seen that gown before."</p>

<p>"<i>Dame!</i> When a person starts out to make a
conquest!"</p>

<p>"You are adorable!"</p>

<p>"Are you quite sure that I am adorable to<span
class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>-night,
charming, ravishing?" Then, looking at
her bracelet attentively, "In that case I don't
see why&mdash;I don't see&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What is it that you don't see, dear?"</p>

<p>"I don't see why you don't come and kiss
me."</p>

<p>And as the kiss was prolonged, she threw
her head back, showing the double row of her
pretty white teeth, exclaiming between her
peals of laughter,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Give me some more <i>pâté</i>! I want some
more <i>pâté</i>! Take care! You are going to
break my Bohemian glass, the fruit of my
economy! There is always some disaster when
you try to kiss me. You remember at Madame
de Brill's ball, two nights before we were married,
how you tore my gown while we were
waltzing in the little parlor?"</p>

<p>"Well, but it is very difficult to do two things
at once,&mdash;keep time with the music and kiss
your partner."</p>

<p>"I remember when mamma asked me how I
tore my gown, I felt that I was blushing up to
the roots of my hair. And Madame D., that old
yellow witch, said to me with her lenten smile,
'What a brilliant color you have to-night, my
child!' I could have choked her! I said I
had caught my gown on a nail in the door.
I was watching you out of the corner of my eye.<span
class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
You were twirling your mustache, and you
seemed quite vexed. You keep all the truffles
for yourself,&mdash;how nice of you! Not that one;
I want that big black one there,&mdash;in the corner.
Well, after all, it was none the less very wrong,
because&mdash;no, no, don't fill my glass; I don't
want to get tipsy&mdash;because if we had not married
(that might have happened, you know;
they say that marriages hang by a thread), well,
if the thread had not been strong enough, here
I was left with that kiss on my shoulder,&mdash;a
pretty plight!"</p>

<p>"Nonsense! It does not stain."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, it does; I beg your pardon, but it
does stain, and so much so that there are husbands,
I am told, who spill their blood to wash
out those little stains."</p>

<p>"I was only jesting, dear. Heavens! I
should think it did! Fancy! Why&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah, I am glad to hear you say so. I like
to see you get angry. You are just a wee bit
jealous, tell me, are you not? Well, upon my
word! I asked you for the big black one, and
you are quietly eating it!"</p>

<p>"I am very sorry, my love; I beg your pardon.
I forgot all about it."</p>

<p>"Yes, just as you did when we were being
married. I was obliged to touch your elbow to<span
class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
make you answer yes to Monsieur the Mayor's
kind words!"</p>

<p>"Kind words?"</p>

<p>"Yes, kind words. I thought the mayor was
charming. No one could have been more
happy than he was in addressing me. 'Mademoiselle,
do you consent to take this great big
ugly little man who stands beside you for your
lawful&mdash;' [Laughing with her mouth full.] I
was about to say to him, 'Let us understand each
other, Monsieur; there is much to be said for
and against.' Heavens! I am choking! [Bursts
into great peals of laughter.] I was wrong in not
making some restrictions. There! I am teasing
you, and that is stupid. I said yes with my
whole heart, I assure you, my darling, and the
word was only too weak. When I think that all
women, even the bad ones, use that same word,
I feel ashamed of not having invented a better
one. [Holding up her glass.] Here is to our
golden wedding!"</p>

<p>"And here is to his christening, little
mother!"</p>

<p>In an undertone: "Tell me, dear, are you
sorry you married me?"</p>

<p>(Laughing.) "Yes. [Kissing her on the
shoulder.] I think I have found the stain.
Here it is."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span></p>

<p>"Do you realize that it is two o'clock. The
fire is out. I am&mdash;you won't laugh? Well,
I am just a little dizzy!"</p>

<p>"That was a famous <i>pâté</i>!"</p>

<p>"A famous <i>pâté</i>! We will have a cup of tea
in the morning, eh, dear?"</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Yesterday</span>
was my birthday.
A number of friends
who have never seen me
wrote to congratulate me
upon having reached the
age of eighty. They are
mistaken; I am not as
old as all that. I can
readily understand that a
few years more or less make very little difference
to them, but they certainly make all the difference
in the world to me. I am still far from the dignity
of an octogenarian; yet I confess that I am
very old, and at my age one likes to recall one's
early childhood. It is a very well-known fact
that old people,&mdash;it seems that I am old, which
makes me furious, and I really believe that I
should scarcely realize it, if people did not take
particular pains, out of pure kindness, of course,
to remind me of it every moment,&mdash;it is a well-known
fact, I say, that old people recall the first
scenes of their life with marvellous accuracy. I<span
class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
have often heard Chevreul speak of having been
present on the Place de la Révolution at the very
moment when Louis XVI. was executed. His
nurse had carried him there, the wretch! He
neither saw nor understood anything; but he
remembered the words of a <i>garde nationale</i>
who scolded the woman for having brought a
child to such a place. "He delivered there
and then a perfect sermon on the subject," he
used to say, "and I remember every word of it."
But let us not speak of tragedies.</p>

<p>I want to take you with me to Brittany, not
without having first warned you against myself,
however. You must not take me too literally
when I describe the customs of that country.
My descriptions are absolutely faithful, but they
represent Brittany as it was from 1815 to 1830.
I went back there this summer after an absence
of half a century, and I recognized nothing but
the scenery. The men are all civilized, and far
more Parisian than I. In order to re-classify
them I should have been compelled to drive
them back to their national dress, that they so
foolishly gave up.</p>

<p>I will take you back, therefore, to the year
1822; and you would not doubt it for an instant
if you could follow me into my father's study.
The walls were papered with Republican money.
He had obtained it in exchange for cash; and<span
class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
when it turned out to be as worthless as waste
paper, he determined that it should be of some
use to him anyway. I fancy that its usefulness
consisted in reminding him of the fragility of
human things. The walls were also decorated
with portraits of the royal family, from the King
down to M. de Villèle, all tacked on with pins.
But these portraits were not to be relied upon,
for when they were turned upside down, they
represented, by some ingenious combination,
the Ogre of Corsica, the King of Rome, and the
Empress Marie Louise. They were suited to
all tastes and all opinions.</p>

<p>This extraordinary study was situated on the
first floor,&mdash;for our house had a first floor, differing
thus from the other houses of the borough,
which had nothing but a ground floor. It also
had a slate roof, which filled me with legitimate
pride. It looked out upon the street which circled
the graveyard; and I will say at once, to
be sincere, that there was no other street in St.
Jean Brévelay. This view and this neighborhood
will not strike you, with your modern ideas, as
very attractive; but in Brittany we like graveyards,&mdash;I
might even say that we like sadness.
And then in this graveyard stood the church,&mdash;an
imposing church, I can assure you, with a
vault upon which hell was faithfully represented
on one side and heaven on the other. Near our<span
class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
window there was also a great fir, which was worth
a whole forest in itself, and which sheltered a
formidable number of crows. If, however, in
spite of this double attraction one found no
pleasure in contemplating the view from that side,
we had another façade to resort to,&mdash;a façade
opening upon an immense and magnificent garden.
There you might have looked down upon
a patch of cabbage, a patch of French beans, of
peas, of carrots, and of potatoes. We had flowers
too,&mdash;so many flowers, so many vegetables,
and so much fruit, that we made gratuitous distributions
of them every Sunday. Besides our
apple-trees, the branches of which bent under
the weight of the fruit, we had pear-trees, cherry-trees,
and plum-trees. My father, who had
travelled considerably, particularly through the
South, prided himself upon his enterprising spirit.
Every year when the plums had been picked, he
collected them in great piles; from these piles
the best were chosen, put upon a species of riddles,
and the riddles were laid in the sun. This
was with a view to making prunes. The plums
rotted in a few days; the birds and other animals
ate them; and soon there was nothing left but
the stones. These were then thrown into the
street, where we used to pick them up, in order
to make piles and stick a little flag in the top.<span
class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
The next year my father proceeded to make
prunes in precisely the same manner.</p>

<p>We were very proud of our rose-bushes, which
furnished roses for the altars, and of our apple-trees,
from which we obtained a most excellent
cider. We had our wine-press, our kneading-trough,
our oven, and our laundrying basins.
We had pastures for our cows, wheat-fields, fields
of buckwheat and of rye. We sowed just enough
to supply our wants. There was no mill in our
village, so we were compelled to send our grain
to Pontécouvrant. When it was ground, it was
brought back and made into very good rye
bread for our daily use. We also made a great
loaf of wheat bread once a week, which we used
for the soup.</p>

<p>Every morning my father started out, gun on
shoulder,&mdash;for in those days there were no rural
constables nor gendarmes (the gendarmes were
at Plumelec), and one could hunt all the year
round. He came in at noon for dinner, and at
six o'clock for supper. My greatest delight consisted
in running to meet him and looking into
his game-bag. I never found any game in it,
but it often contained a big trout or some fine
eels. We eventually discovered that the hunt
was a mere pretext, and that his real passion
was fishing. He was extremely taciturn, as all
of his children have been after him, and I be<span
class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>lieve
that to be one of the essential qualities of
an angler.</p>

<p>During dinner he never breathed a word. In
the evening at supper he described the events of
the day, when he had been lucky. We took our
meals in the kitchen, which was vast and cleanly.
There were twenty of us at table, and sometimes
more, owing to the legendary Breton hospitality.
The table formed a long rectangle. My mother
occupied one end of it with my sisters and myself;
my father sat at the other end alone; while
the two long sides were reserved for the servants.
These were no less than twelve in number:
the gardener, the ploughman, the shepherd,
the stable-boy, and the maid-servants.
This will no doubt give you the impression of
the household of a wealthy farmer or a country
gentleman. Not at all. In the beautiful borough
of St. Jean Brévelay there was neither butcher,
baker, nor grocer. The only merchants that I
ever saw there were a mercer and a tavern-keeper.
One was compelled to send to Vannes,
seven leagues away, for everything, or else live
like Robinson Crusoe on his island.</p>

<p>I have learned since that the ploughman, who
was our first man, earned only thirty francs a
year. I leave you to judge of the rest. It was
a poor country, and one could enjoy all the comforts
which it afforded with an income of twelve<span
class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
hundred francs a year. One of our chief pleasures
consisted in the care of our garden. My
mother had a little bed in which roses, tulips,
pansies, and daisies grew in abundance. She
was particularly fond of mignonette and honey-suckle.
The hedge around our kitchen-garden
was covered with honey-suckle, elder, and a
whole family of sweet-smelling creepers, over
which our bees hovered and buzzed. There
was seldom a day when we did not walk around
the garden once, and that was quite a journey.
We had another habit which I do not understand
as well, and which consisted in walking around
Colas' field every day after dinner; that is, at
one o'clock. We first went down a hollow road
where the mud was not wanting when it had
rained. The flowers were not wanting there either
in summer; we walked under a real vault of them.
This road led to the blacksmith's shop, where I
always found something to admire,&mdash;the great
bellows, the incandescent iron, the sparks flying
from the furnace like joyous fireworks. Next to
the blacksmith's shop stood Marion's house,&mdash;the
last house at the end of the village. Marion
was a girl of twenty who had lost her mother
when she was eighteen. Everybody had advised
her to go into service; but she had preferred to
engage herself to my mother as a seamstress, by
the year. Her house&mdash;"Marion's house," as it<span
class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
was always spoken of&mdash;belonged to her. It was
not a great dowry. It consisted of two rooms
under a thatched roof, and a little yard where
she raised her chickens. She had been warned
against the dangers of living alone at her age,
and in a comparatively isolated place; but she
was a fearless girl and somewhat unsociable.
She had discovered, I do not know where,&mdash;in
one of the neighboring farms, perhaps,&mdash;a widow
who was only too happy to occupy one of her
rooms gratuitously, and who was a companion
and a protection to her when she came home
after her day's work.</p>

<p>Colas' field began at Marion's door. It was
surely not what one would call beautiful. We
walked straight before us, and got back to our
starting-point at the end of an hour without having
seen anything but apple-trees and furrows.
On Sunday when this task had been accomplished,
we found Marion in her yard among her
chickens, waiting to go to vespers with us. I
always took her hand, and she told me stories of
Poulpiquets.</p>

<p>I led a joyful life. My mother, too, seemed
happy. Her chief occupation lay in nursing the
sick, and her heaviest expense in providing them
with broth and drugs; the latter were sent for to
the druggist's at Bignan. I had never seen a
doctor until I went to Lorient to enter school.<span
class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
Whenever she had a perplexing case, she called
my father into consultation. As he had been a
soldier, nothing surprised him. His method
was to bleed. He one day undertook to vaccinate
the entire population, and succeeded in
doing so by offering five cents to all those who
consented to honor him with their trust. This
philanthropic operation must have made a great
hole in the household budget.</p>

<p>We had a library which contained fully twenty
volumes. My sisters spent their time in taking
them from my mother's room, and my mother
in taking them from their hands. There were,&mdash;"Celina,
or, The Child of Mystery and of Love;"
"Alexis, or, The Wooden Cottage;" "The
Helmet and the Square Cap, or, Both suited
him." We also had, "The Evenings at the
Château," by Madame de Genlis, "The Yellow
Tales," and "Robinson Crusoe." I was of
course not permitted to touch the novels. I
was allowed "Robinson Crusoe," "The Yellow
Tales," and "The Evenings at the Château," of
which permission I availed myself eagerly, for I
was ever a great reader. "Robinson Crusoe"
particularly delighted me, and I read it three or
four times a year. I had also a tender feeling
for "Celina," which I only half understood. In
the first place, it represented the forbidden fruit;
and in the next place, it had pictures. I never<span
class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
got to the <i>dénouement</i>, because my mother, seeing
that I was incorrigible, resolved to burn the
<i>cuerpo del
<span class="replace" id="tn_10" title="In the printed book: delicto">delito</span></i>.</p>

<p>If I add that in rummaging through the closets
and wardrobes I had found "L'Esprit des Lois"
and an odd volume of the "Political and Philosophical
History of the Two Indies," and that I
read them, you will no doubt believe that I am
trying to make myself out an infant prodigy. It
was quite the reverse, for I preferred the Abbé
Raynal to Montesquieu, and what I was most
charmed with in the Abbé Raynal was some absurd
rant about a mistress called Catchinka,
whom he had lost, and who in some remarkable
way formed a part of the Philosophical
History of the Two Indies. This strange library
produced a veritable chaos in my poor little
brain, over which floated "Robinson." It
was the genuine "Robinson" too,&mdash;a translation
of the work of Daniel Defoe, which, as
every one knows, contains as many sermons as
it does events.</p>

<p>But what I liked better than "Robinson,"
better than "Celina," better than my garden,
better than the eternal walks around Colas' field,
was the church service on religious holidays,
the "pompous grandeur of its ceremonies."
Yes, the "pompous grandeur,"&mdash;I will not retract.
Since then I have seen St. Peter's, the<span
class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
cathedrals of Cologne and Toledo, and, I believe,
all the finest churches in the world; yet
I never attended service anywhere without recalling
the poor little church of St. Jean Brévelay.
The difference between the palace of a
king and the thatched cottage of a peasant is
far greater than that between the august basilica
and the poor little tottering chapel of a Breton
village. May the artists forgive me, but a church,
however poor and small, is none the less a
church. Four bare walls, a wooden cross upon
a table, windows so covered with dust that they
scarcely let the light in,&mdash;all these things speak
to the soul of meditation and of prayer.</p>

<p>I do not know what the population of St.
Jean Brévelay was. It could not have been over
two hundred; but on Sunday the people came to
High Mass from the four corners of the parish,
which was vast and populous. The farmhouses
and thatched cottages all emptied themselves at
the first glow of dawn. You could see the families
making their way to the borough along every
known road&mdash;the men leading the way in silence,
the women following in noisy talk among
themselves. They at first scattered through the
graveyard, every family stopping to say a prayer
at the family tomb. Then the friends and relatives
came together in groups, and the men
made more than one escape to the tavern. At<span
class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
the last call for High Mass they all rushed to the
church doors, pushing, jostling, crowding one
another, until the building was filled from end to
end. The graveyard&mdash;I might say the borough&mdash;was
now a perfect desert. The men, standing,
and pressed close together, occupied all the
front part of the nave; the women, kneeling,
filled the rear. All, without exception, took
part in the singing. The common serpent was
unknown to us; but with our voices alone we
managed to make a formidable noise. The people
were happy to be there, not because, as Voltaire
says, "High Mass is the opera of the poor,"
but because, as the Christian Church says, religion
is the consolation of the afflicted. The
rector delivered his sermons in Low Breton, and
they were never anything but a paraphrase of
this word of the Gospel, Love one another.
And surely they loved one another, those uncultured
folk. They did not know how to read,
but they knew how to love. They understood
gratitude too. My mother was almost an object
of worship.</p>

<p>The great festival of the year, after that of
Saint Louis, was Christmas. The King first and
God next, such is the order of precedence under
all governments. It is possible that our
poor peasants would have reversed that order
had they been able to do so.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span></p>

<p>I must say, in order not to give them more
praise than they deserve, that what they liked
best about Christmas was the midnight Mass,&mdash;a
sorry enjoyment for you city-bred people,
who are fond of your comforts. But what is a
sleepless night to a peasant? Even when they
had to plod along through the mud or the snow,
not an old man, not a woman hesitated. Umbrellas
were then unknown at St. Jean Brévelay,
or at least ours was the only one that had
ever been seen there, and it was naturally the
object of much surprise and admiration.</p>

<p>The women caught up their skirts with pins,
threw a plaid kerchief over their head-dresses,
and started out bravely for the parish church in
their wooden shoes. Sleep, forsooth! Who
could have slept even had he wanted to? The
chimes began the night before immediately after
the evening Angelus, and were repeated every
half-hour until midnight. The hunters, in order
to contribute to the general beatitude, kept up a
steady firing. My father furnished the powder.
It was a universal and deafening clamor. The
small boys took part in it too, at the risk of
maiming themselves, whenever they could lay
their hands on a gun or a pistol.</p>

<p>The vicarage was a short half-league from the
borough. The rector came over on his nag,
which the <i>quinquiss</i> (the beadle) led by the<span
class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
bridle. A dozen peasants escorted him, firing
their pistols in his ears all the while. But this
did not disturb him in the least, for he was an
old Chouan with the death of many a Blue on
his conscience,&mdash;withal, the kindest and most
compassionate of men since the king had returned
and he had become a priest.</p>

<p>On that night great preparations were made at
home. Telin-Charles and Le Halloco measured
the fireplace and the kitchen door with as much
earnestness and importance as though they had
not known their dimensions by heart for many
years. The question was to bring in the Yule
log and to have it as large as possible.</p>

<p>A great tree was felled for the purpose; four
oxen were harnessed; and the log was dragged
to the house. It took eight or ten men to lift it,
and to carry it in. It would scarcely fit in the
fireplace. Then it was adorned with garlands; it
was propped and stayed by the trunks of young
trees; and an enormous bunch of wild-flowers,
or rather of live plants, was placed on top of it.
The long table was removed from the kitchen.
We took our light meal standing. The walls
were hung with white table-cloths and sheets,
just as they are at Corpus Christi; and upon
them were pinned numerous drawings done by
my sister Louise and my sister Hermine,&mdash;the
Virgin, the Christ-Child, etc. There were <span
class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>inscriptions
too, "Et homo factus est!" All the
chairs were removed to make as much room as
possible for our visitors, who were not accustomed
to sitting on anything better than their
heels. One chair was left for my mother and one
for my Aunt Gabrielle, who was treated with much
deference on account of her eighty-six years.</p>

<p>She was the one, my children, for stories of
the Terror! Everybody around me knew many
such stories, for that matter,&mdash;my father particularly,
if he had only chosen to speak. He
had been a Blue; and his obstinate silence was
no doubt due to prudence in a part of the country
that was so full of Chouans.</p>

<p>The confusion was such in the kitchen, with
everybody wanting to be useful, to carry in
branches of fir, of broom, and of holly; the noise
was so deafening on account of the hammering
of nails and the rattling of pots and kettles; and
then there came such a clamor from without,&mdash;ringing
of bells, firing of guns, songs, conversations,
and clatter of wooden shoes,&mdash;that it
seemed like the din of a fair at the very climax
of its animation. At half-past eleven the cry,
"Eutru Person! Eutru Person!" ("The rector!
The rector!") resounded all along the
street. It was taken up in the kitchen, and all
the men started out immediately. The women
alone remained with the family. When the rector<span
class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
reached our door, there was a moment of
profound silence. He dismounted. It was I
who had the honor of holding his nag by the
bridle; that is, I was supposed to do so, but
somebody else always did it for me. Heaven
knows there was no need of holding the poor
beast anyway.</p>

<p>M. Moizan walked up three steps to the landing,
turned toward the crowd that stood below
him, hat in hand, removed his own hat, and
said, after making the sign of the cross, "<i>Angelus
Domini</i> nuntiavit Mariæ." A thousand
voices responded.</p>

<p>When the prayer was over, he entered the
house, spoke cordially to my father and mother,
to M. Ozon, the mayor, who had just arrived from
Pénic-Pichon, and to M. Oillo, the blacksmith,
who was also the justice's clerk. Then he proceeded
to the benediction of the Yule log.</p>

<p>My father and mother stood on the left-hand
side of the hearth. Those women whom their
importance or their intimate terms with the
family permitted to remain in the sanctuary,
which in this case means the kitchen, knelt in a
semi-circle around the hearth. The men were
crowded together in the hall, the door of which
was left open, and they overflowed into the
street as far as the graveyard. Every now and
then a woman who had been detained by some<span
class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
domestic care cleft the crowd and came forward
to where the others were kneeling.</p>

<p>Aunt Gabrielle, arrayed in her mantle, which
always bespoke a solemn occasion, knelt in the
middle of the semi-circle, directly in front of the
Yule log, with a holy-water basin and a branch
of box beside her. She started a hymn which
all the assistants repeated in chorus.</p>

<p>I have forgotten the words of that hymn, and
I really regret it. The air was monotonous and
plaintive, like all those that were sung at our
firesides. However, it contained a crescendo at
the moment of the benediction which generally
sent a shiver through me, producing what is commonly
known as goose-flesh.</p>

<p>Aunt Gabrielle had just reached that part
of the hymn on the 25th of December, 1822,
when I became aware of a strange confusion
among the male voices outside. The women
either stopped singing entirely, or sang out of
time and tune; the voices chased after one another,
scarcely sustained themselves, and seemed
stifled by a sudden emotion. My mother's hand,
which held mine, trembled for a moment, then
grew firm by a great effort of her will. Her
voice rose, soared above the voices of the others,
who, realizing at once that they had wandered
inopportunely, hurried back to the fold, and so the
hymn ended in good order after this surprising<span
class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
interruption. What had happened? Something
very simple indeed. A young woman had made
her way through the crowd, had entered the
kitchen, and apparently anxious to remain unnoticed,
had fallen on her knees at a little distance
from the others, and buried her face in her hands.
I recognized her at once. It was Marion, my
favorite, the best seamstress on the place, and
the prettiest girl in the borough. I would surely
have run forward to kiss her but for the solemnity
of the occasion, which forbade my leaving
my place or making a noise. She was weeping
bitterly. Why are you weeping, my sweet
Marion? I was wild to have the ceremony end,
that I might find out from her. All the other
girls seemed embarrassed. My mother alone,
whom I looked full in the face, appeared calm;
but her face lied,&mdash;I knew it by the trembling
of her hand.</p>

<p>After the benediction of the Yule log it was
the custom for all the women present to kiss my
mother before proceeding to the church. They
came up in good order, one after another; and
in spite of their number, which amounted to
some thirty or forty, this formality only required
a few minutes. I think that my mother yielded
to it rather in spite of herself, for she was an extremely
reserved woman; but all these kind
souls would have believed that the laws of the<span
class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
universe had been reversed if this part of the
ceremony had been left out.</p>

<p>As mistress of ceremonies, and on account of
her great age, Aunt Gabrielle opened the march.</p>

<p>Now, Aunt Gabrielle was a character. She
was the living repertory of folk-songs, legends,
and customs. People came from everywhere to
consult her when they wanted to know how such
and such a thing should be done. Perhaps you
believe that etiquette is peculiar to palaces.
Most assuredly not. In my day a wedding had
more than a thousand equally important formalities.
My good aunt, who was the oracle of these
forms, had never made use of them for herself.</p>

<p>She was an old maid, born at Belle-Isle-en-Mer
under Louis XV., and was a distant cousin
of ours. We have relationships in Brittany
which can be expressed in no language, they are
so remote. My father, who never thought of
himself until everybody else had been provided
for, had brought out a whole tribe of poor relatives
with him to St. Jean Brévelay. I think,
however, that Aunt Gabrielle was an exception.
She gave more than she received. She was our
cook, I beg you to believe, and a most excellent
one too. She was active, laborious, always
equal to the expedients of her profession, always
bright and contented, full of delicate attentions
for everybody, particularly for Marguerite (my<span
class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
mother), her best beloved; but my good mother
was everybody's best beloved. I have never in
my life known a woman to be so universally
cherished.</p>

<p>Aunt Gabrielle had only two faults: she
spoiled children horribly, and she gave the poor
whatever she could lay her hands on. It often
happened that after a too liberal distribution of
supplies among her beggars, she would set before
us at dinner a dish so ridiculously out of
proportion to the requirements of our appetites
that she would herself burst into a laugh as she
looked at it. We all joined in the laugh, which
seemed to make us forget how hungry we were.
She was the factotum of the house, and was just
as exacting and despotic as she was kind.</p>

<p>On that night she was greatly excited; and
when she came up to kiss my mother, instead of
folding her in her arms as she was in the habit
of doing, she whispered something to her with
an expression of importance and anger.</p>

<p>"Calm yourself, Gabrielle; calm yourself,"
my mother said to her several times, and I felt
her hand tremble.</p>

<p>"No, my dear, I cannot help it! And if you
do not choose to do it, I will do it myself."</p>

<p>"You will do nothing of the sort," said my
mother. "And you will remember that I am
the mistress in my own house."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span></p>

<p>She pushed her gently, that the others might
move along; but Aunt Gabrielle joined the
women who were going out, several of whom
stopped to speak to her. They were all making
gestures of indignation as they looked at poor
Marion, who had withdrawn into the darkest
corner of the hall, and there stood with her
head down and her face turned away from
them.</p>

<p>Finally they seemed to have taken a resolution,
and they moved toward her as though to
drive her away; but they were stopped by these
few words, uttered in a low tone, and at which
all the conversations ceased at once.</p>

<p>"Come to me, Marion."</p>

<p>Marion started as though she meant to spring
forward; but she checked herself and crossed
the room slowly with hesitating steps. My
mother kissed her on both cheeks just as she
had kissed the others. I realized that she was
performing what she considered a duty, and that
she too greatly disapproved of my poor friend.</p>

<p>Gabrielle held up her arms in horror.</p>

<p>"Do not dare to come to work to-morrow!"
she cried aloud; "for you will never work for us
again. I discharge you; do you understand?"</p>

<p>She understood but too well. It was as
though she had just heard her death-sentence.
There was no house but ours where she could<span
class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
find work as a seamstress, and to discharge her
was like condemning her to starvation.</p>

<p>My mother's voice was heard again, low, but
full of gentle firmness.</p>

<p>"To-morrow Marion's work will be taken to
her at her own house."</p>

<p>"I will not be the one to take it," cried Aunt
Gabrielle, whose words produced a murmur of
approbation.</p>

<p>"Then I will take it myself," said my mother,
"if I can find no one to obey me."</p>

<p>Marion had disappeared.</p>

<p>There were only a few women left; their
cheeks were aglow with anger. The resin candles
had been put out. The room was lighted
by the Yule log only, which blazed in the
fireplace.</p>

<p>"Let us go and pray God," said my mother,
slipping her arm through that of Gabrielle, who
protested and submitted at the same time, and
kissed my mother fully ten times before we
reached the church.</p>

<p>The church was dazzling, for the simple
reason that as there was no way of lighting it,
no lamps of any description, every faithful was
requested to bring a light with him. There
were surely a thousand persons in the building,
which represented a thousand lights. I will
confess that these were neither lamps nor<span
class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
tapers nor even vulgar tallow candles. They
were mere wax lighters, which singly you may
despise as you please, but which, multiplied
thus, formed a luminous floor under the dark
vault: when you looked down, it was joyous,
dazzling; and when you looked up, it was appalling.
The altar fairly glittered. All of our
candles figured there in addition to those which
belonged to the church. There was just room
enough between the lights for the chalice and
the missal. The rector was arrayed in a fine
scarlet chasuble, a bit worn and faded, which
had survived the Revolution. The mayor occupied
the seat of honor, wearing the dress of
the Breton peasant,&mdash;blue vest embroidered in
red and yellow silk, with a splendid sun in the
middle of the back. Beside him sat the deputy
mayor, M. Adelys, the miller of Kerdroguen;
and both wore white silk sashes which covered
their breasts and stomachs. The blacksmith
was there too in his quality of justice's clerk,
wearing the black gown and cap of the magistracy.
M. de la Goublaye, the justice and
chevalier of Saint Louis, had been detained in
his château of Keriennec by the gout. But we
had a corporal of gendarmery opposite the altar
and two gendarmes on either side with yellow
shoulder-belts. Plumelec, where they lived,
would have gladly enough kept them at home<span
class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
on such an occasion, but St. Jean Brévelay
was the chief town of the canton.</p>

<p>At the appearance of the celebrant the corporal
cried out,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Gendarmes, hands to your sabres!" Whereupon
the music, consisting of a fife and a drum,
filled the church. That was the supreme moment
of my life. I conquered sleep so as not
to miss it. I thought of it through the whole
year. You will not wonder, therefore, when I
tell you that I forgot all about Marion from midnight
until about two o'clock.</p>

<p>Everything was over by two o'clock. The
fife and drum had escorted the priest to the
rectory; the <i>quinquiss</i> had put out the lights on
the altar; and as all the faithful had blown upon
their meagre luminaries the church was completely
dark. In a few moments it was deserted,
and not a sound was to be heard save that of
the swaying pendulum. On the other hand, the
graveyard was crowded. If it happened to be
raining or snowing too hard, the people took refuge
in the houses; but they gave this proof of
weakness only when they could no longer hold
out. The taverns were overflowing with customers.
Some people stood a little table out at
their door, and upon it they placed a loaf, a
<i>cervelas</i>, and numerous bottles of cider, thus
defrauding, in connivance with the authority,<span
class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
the tax on consumable commodities. At three
o'clock the bells rang for the Mass of the
Aurora.</p>

<p>After the ceremony our people came for us
and awaited us at the church door with a huge
red cotton umbrella, which did us as much
honor as the same utensil does a Roman cardinal.
We were also provided with an extra pair
of wooden shoes half filled with warm ashes.
We hastened home, exchanging courtesies with
all, but stopping with no one; for there was a
Christmas supper in our kitchen,&mdash;a supper to
which all our friends were invited, and besides
them all the servants who had been present at
the blessing of the Yule log.</p>

<p>During midnight Mass the great kitchen table
had been replaced by boards laid as evenly as
possible upon props. These were covered by a
cloth of dazzling whiteness,&mdash;the pride of my
poor mother, who used to bleach it on the grass
of our meadow. On this occasion we had candles
on the table,&mdash;real candles, of seven to the
pound, which were sent for a week beforehand
to Vannes. We considered our menu decidedly
sumptuous. We had buckwheat pancakes, accompanied
by numerous pots of cider and the
most delicious butter. After that, we were
helped to a porringer of the very worst chocolate
that was ever manufactured by a country<span
class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
grocer. We tried to convince ourselves that
this course was excellent. It had to be served
on that day, and to be drunk, and to be praised,
but then we had the pleasure of feeling that we
should not be called upon to repeat the sacrifice
for a year. We also had a home-cured
ham and rye bread. Everybody stood up during
the <i>Benedicite</i>, then those who found room
on the benches sat down; the others helped
themselves over the heads of these privileged
ones, and took their share out into the street
with them.</p>

<p>The assailants succeeded one another until
the table was cleared. Everybody was cheerful
and contented; there was never a man who
forgot himself. These peasants, who had had
no breeding, were by nature well-bred. Then
they all loved one another in that country of poor
people; and, above all,&mdash;may I be allowed to
say it? the thought is so pleasing to me in my
old age,&mdash;they all loved us.</p>

<p>I never remained until the end. I merely
stepped in to get a peep at the beautiful celebration
and to fill my eyes and my imagination
with it. On the night to which I refer I managed
to stay down longer than usual. I looked
for Marion everywhere. There were others,
too, who were looking for her. My mother's
conduct had been criticised and rather disapproved<span
class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
of; for those were simple folk, virtuous
themselves and pitiless to others. If Marion
had been brutally discharged, they would have
applauded. Now they believed her to be forgiven;
and they felt her forgiveness to be in
a measure an encouragement to vice. Aunt
Gabrielle had found time to speak to the rector,
to excuse Marguerite, she said; but without
realizing it she had merely expressed her disapprobation.
I not only remember all these
details after sixty-five years, but I remember the
room in which the scene took place. I can
even evoke the faces and the attitudes,&mdash;the
saintly protectress, somewhat moved, but very
resolute; the rector, restless and anxious; Gabrielle
and her confederates, pitiless in their
censure. Although not a word had been uttered
in my presence concerning the nature of
Marion's fault, I had understood it all, thanks to
"Celina," no doubt. It is useless to state which
side my heart was on. The priest was anxious
above all things to preserve in our parish those
rigid customs for which we were famed.</p>

<p>"A moral plague must be treated just like a
physical plague, with heroic remedies," said he.</p>

<p>"We must be charitable," said my mother.
"Our God is a God of charity."</p>

<p>The priest was of the opinion that the sinner
should not under any consideration be allowed<span
class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
to come back to the house and work among the
maid-servants.</p>

<p>"Why, of course not; I never thought of
such a thing," said my mother, in that sweet
voice of hers that reached one's soul. "We
must make this an example, a warning for our
girls. I will see to that, never fear. I am just
as anxious about it as you are. She will live
alone with her child. I did not care to crush
her under the weight of a public anathema, nor
would I be so inexorable as to condemn her to
mendicity or debauch, that is all. I said to my
poor Gabrielle, who is so ungovernable to-night,"
she added, smiling, "that I would take her work
myself if I found nobody to obey me; but that
is not exactly what I meant. What I meant
was this: I will go to her myself; I will go every
day. I will assume, or rather encroach upon
your rights. I will exhort, I will preach to her;
I will make her see that she is among sisters
whom her conduct has grieved, but among
sisters, nevertheless."</p>

<p>She said all this with kindness, simplicity, and
firmness.</p>

<p>The priest lifted his broad-brimmed hat from
his head. "I uncover my white hair before you,
Madame," said he, in a loud voice, "and I pray
God to bless the task that you have undertaken
for his sake. My children, Marion will come<span
class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
back and work among you when she has made
atonement for her fault. Until then I leave
her entirely in your mistress's hands. If she
does not lead her back to the path of virtue,
we priests will have to give it up. Our Latin
will not help us out of it."</p>

<p>This very mild pleasantry excited much admiration,
as everything did that fell from those
venerable lips.</p>

<p>For my part I was delighted, having a confused
impression that we had gained a great
victory; and I ran off to bed after having kissed
my mother with unusual tenderness.</p>

</div>

<h3>I.</h3>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">The poor</span>
little one had ceased
to moan; she turned her
head slightly and stared
with wide eyes at those who stood around her
bed; her breath came fainter, fainter, until it
stopped altogether. She was dead. The guardian
angel uttered a deep sigh, unfolded his
wings, and flew away.</p>

<p>The poor mother could not believe in the
reality of so much sorrow; still Celinina's exquisite
face was growing diaphanous and yellow,
like wax; her limbs were cold; and her body
finally became rigid and hard like that of a doll.
Then the mother was led away from the alcove,
while the father, the nearest relatives, two or
three friends, and the servants performed the last
duties toward the dead child.</p>

<p>They dressed her in a beautiful gown of lawn
that was as white and as sheer as a cloud, and<span
class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
covered with frills and laces that looked like
foam. They put on her shoes, which were white
too, and whose soles showed that they had taken
but few steps. They braided her lovely dark
chestnut hair, and arranged it gracefully about
her head, intertwining it with blue ribbons.
They tried to find fresh flowers, but the season
was too far advanced, and there were none to
be had; so they made her a wreath of artificial
ones, selecting only those which were beautiful
and which might have been mistaken for real blossoms
just from the garden. Then a very repulsive
man brought a box, just a trifle larger than
the case of a violin, lined with blue silk and elaborately
adorned with white satin and silver braid.
Celinina was laid in it: an exquisite soft pillow
was placed under her head, so that her position
might not seem strained; and when she had been
carefully and tenderly fixed in her funereal couch,
they crossed her little hands, tied them together
with a ribbon, and slipped a bunch of white
roses between them,&mdash;roses so artistically fashioned
that they seemed to be the very children
of Spring.</p>

<p>The women threw gorgeous draperies over a
table, adorned it like an altar, and laid the coffin
upon it. They arranged other altars, too, after
the manner of church canopies, with fine white
curtains, gracefully caught back on either side.<span
class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
They brought a great quantity of saints and
images from other rooms, which they disposed
with great art in symmetrical groups, forming a
sort of funereal court around the departed angel.
They also brought in, without losing a moment,
the great candelabrum from the parlor, and
lighted several dozen tapers, which shed their
mournful glow upon Celinina. Then they kissed
the child's frozen cheek again and again, and
their pious task was done.</p>


<h3>II.</h3>

<p>From the other end of the house, from the
depths of the bedrooms, came the moans of a
man and a woman, the heart-rending lamentations
of the parents who could not be convinced
of the truth of those aphorisms about angels in
heaven, administered by friends as a sort of moral
sedative on these occasions. They believed,
on the contrary, that this world is the proper
and natural habitation for angels; nor could
they admit the theory that the death of a grown
person is far more lamentable and disastrous
than that of a child. Mingled with their grief
was that profound pity which the death-agony of
an infant always inspires, and to them there was
no sorrow in life like that which was tearing
their very vitals. A thousand memories and<span
class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
painful visions struck at their hearts like so many
daggers. The mother's ears rang with Celinina's
lispings,&mdash;that enchanting baby-talk that
gets everything wrong, and converts the words
of our language into delicious philological caricatures,
which caricatures, flowing from rosy
mouths, are the tenderest and most affecting
music to a mother's heart.</p>

<p>Nothing so characterizes a child as his style,&mdash;his
spontaneous mode of expression, the art of
saying everything with four letters, his prehistoric
grammar, which is like the first sobbing of
the words at the dawn of humanity, his simple
rules of declension and conjugation, innocent
corrections of the languages which usage has legitimatized.
The vocabulary of a child of three,
like Celinina, is the real literary treasure of a
family. How could her mother ever forget the
little pink tongue that said "wat" for hat, and
called a bean a "ween"! No matter where she
turned, the good woman's eyes were sure to
fall upon some of the toys with which Celinina
had cheered the last days of her life; and as
these were the days that preceded Christmas,
the floor was strewn with little clay turkeys on
wire legs, a Saint Joseph that had lost both
hands, a manger in which lay the Christ-Child,
like a little pink ball, a wise man from the
Orient mounted upon a proud, headless camel.<span
class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
What these poor little figures had endured during
the past few days, dragged here and there,
made to assume this or that posture, was known
only to God, the mother, and the pure little spirit
that had taken its flight.</p>

<p>All this broken statuary was imbued with
Celinina's very soul,&mdash;clothed with a peculiar
sad light, which was the light from her, as it
were. The mother trembled from head to foot
as she gazed at them, and she felt that the wound
had been dealt to her innermost being. Strange
association of things! How all these broken
pieces of clay seemed to weep! They seemed
so grieved, so full of intense sorrow, that the
sight of them was scarcely less bitter than the
spectacle of the dying child herself, who with
appealing eyes begged her parents to take the
pain away from her burning head. To the
mother nothing could have been more pathetic
than that turkey with its wire legs, which in its
frequent changes of posture had lost its crest
and its bill.</p>


<h3>III.</h3>

<p>The mother's grief was surely intense, but the
father's affliction was still more profound. She
was transpierced with sorrow,&mdash;his pain was
aggravated by the stings of remorse. This is
how it came about. It will no doubt seem very<span
class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
childish to some people; however, let them bear
in mind that nothing is more open to childishness
than a deep, pure sorrow, free from any
touch of worldly interests or the secondary sufferings
of unsatisfied egoism.</p>

<p>From the very first and all through her illness
Celinina's mind was filled with dreams of Christmas,&mdash;of
the poetic celebration supremely delightful
to children. We all know how they long
for the joyful day, how crazed they are by the
feverish yearning for presents and Bethlehem
mangers, by the thought of how much they will
eat, by the prospect of satiating themselves with
turkey, sponge-cake, candied almonds, and nut-pastes.
Some little ones ingenuously believe that
were they only allowed to do so, they might easily
stow away in their stomachs all the displays of
the Plaza Mayor and the adjacent streets.</p>

<p>Celinina in her intervals of relief gave her
whole soul to the engrossing theme. Her little
cousins, who came to sit with her, were older than
she, and had exhausted the entire fund of human
knowledge with regard to celebrations, presents,
and Bethlehem mangers. The poor child's fancy
and her longing for toys and sweets accordingly
grew more and more excited as she listened to
them. In her delirium, when the fever dragged
her into its oven of torture, her prattle was of
the things that preyed upon her mind; and it<span
class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
was all about beating drums and tam-tams, and
singing Christmas carols. The darkness of her
brain was peopled with turkeys, crying, gobble!
gobble! and chickens that said, peep! peep!
mountains of nut-pastes that reached up to the
skies, forming a <i>guadarrama</i> of almonds, Bethlehem
mangers full of lights, and in which there
were fifty thousand million figures at the very least,
great bouquets of sweetmeats, trees laden with
as many toys as can be conceived by the most
fecund Tyrolese imagination, the pond of the
<span class="replace" id="tn_11" title="In the printed book: Retriro">Retiro</span>
filled with almond soup, red gilt-heads
looking up at the cooks with coagulated eyes,
oranges falling from the skies in far greater quantities
than the drops of water during a rainstorm,
and thousands and thousands of other
inexpressible prodigies.</p>


<h3>IV.</h3>

<p>Celinina was an only child; and when she was
taken ill, her father's uneasiness and anxiety knew
no limit. His business called him away during
the day, but he managed to run in every now
and then to see how the little invalid was. The
disease pursued its course with treacherous
alternatives, giving and withdrawing hope.</p>

<p>The good man had his misgivings. The picture
of Celinina, lying in her little bed crushed<span
class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
with pain and fever, never left his mind for a moment.
He was heedful of everything that might
cheer her and brighten the gloom of her suffering,
so every night he brought home with him
some Christmas present, something different
every time, scrupulously avoiding sweets, however.
One day he brought a flock of turkeys, so
cleverly made, so lifelike, that one fairly expected
to hear them gobble. The next night he drew
one half of the Holy Family from his pockets, then
again a little Saint Joseph, the manger and the
portico of the Bethlehem stable. Once it was a
superb drove of sheep driven by proud shepherds,
and later on he brought some washerwomen
washing their clothes, and a sausage-maker
selling sausages, and two Magi, one black
and the other with a white beard and a golden
crown. What did he not bring? He even
brought an old woman very indecorously spanking
a small boy for not knowing his lesson.
From what she had heard her cousins say about
the requirements of a Bethlehem manger, Celinina
knew that hers was incomplete, and this for
want of two very important figures,&mdash;the Mule
and the Ox. Of course she had no idea of the
significance of the Mule or the Ox; but in her
thirst for absolute perfection of composition, she
asked her solicitous father again and again for
the two animals, which seemed to be about the<span
class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
only things that the good man had left in the
toy shops. He accordingly promised to bring
them, and took a firm resolution not to come
home without both beasts; but it happened
that on that day, which was the 23d, he had
an accumulation of things to do. Besides, as
luck would have it, the drawing of the lottery
took place just then, he was notified of having
won a lawsuit, not to speak of the arrival of two
affectionate friends who managed to keep in his
way all the morning; so he came home without
the Mule or the Ox.</p>

<p>Celinina was greatly disappointed when she
found that he had not brought her the two
jewels that were to complete her treasure. The
good man was about to repair his fault immediately,
but just then the doctor came in. Celinina
had grown considerably worse during the
day; and as his words were far from comforting,
nobody thought of mules or oxen.</p>

<p>On the 24th the poor father resolved not to
leave the house. For a brief moment, however,
Celinina seemed so much better that her
parents were wild with hope, and the father said
joyously,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I am going right out to get those things."</p>

<p>But it was not a moment before Celinina fell
into an intense fever, just as a bird, wounded in
its upward flight through the pure regions of the<span
class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
air, drops swiftly to the ground. She tossed
about, trembling and suffocating in the hot arms
of her disease, that tightened around her and
shook her violently as if to eject her life. In
the confusion of her delirium, on the broken
waves of her thoughts, like the one thing saved
from a cataclysm, floated the persistent yearning,
the idea of that longed-for mule and that sighed-for
ox.</p>

<p>The father rushed out of the house like a
madman, then suddenly, "This is no time to
think of figures for a Bethlehem manger,"
thought he; and running here and there, climbing
stairs and ringing door-bells, he succeeded
in getting seven or eight doctors, whom he took
home with him. Celinina should be saved at
any cost.</p>


<h3>V.</h3>

<p>But apparently it was not the will of God that
the seven or eight disciples of Æsculapius should
interfere with the orders he had given, so Celinina
grew worse and worse, struggling with indescribable
anguish, like a bruised butterfly
quivering with broken wings on the ground.
Her parents bent over her with wild anxiety, as
though they expected to detain her in this world
by the power of their will, as though they <span
class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>expected
to arrest the rapid course of human disorganization,
and breathe their own life into the
little martyr, who was exhaling hers in a sigh.</p>

<p>From the street came the thumping of drums
and the jingling of tambourines. Celinina
opened her eyes; and with an appealing look
and a few solemn words, which seemed already
the language of another world, she asked her
father for that which he had failed to bring her.
The father and mother, in their distress, thought
of deceiving her; and with the hope of casting
a ray of happiness through the misery of this
supreme moment they handed her the turkeys,
saying, "Look, my darling, here are the little
mule and the little ox."</p>

<p>But Celinina, even at the point of death, was
conscious enough to know that turkeys can
never be anything but turkeys; and she pushed
them away gently. From that time on she lay
still with her great eyes fixed on her parents,
and her little hand on her head to show them
where the terrible pain was. That rhythmical
sound which is like the last vibration of life
gradually grew fainter and fainter, until it was
hushed entirely, like the machinery of a clock
that has stopped, and the dainty little girl was
only an exquisite scrap of matter, inert, cold,
and as white and transparent as the sublimated
wax that burns on the altars.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span></p>

<p>Now you understand the father's remorse.
To bring his little Celinina back to life he would
have scoured the face of the earth and collected
all the oxen and all the mules upon it. The
thought of not having satisfied this innocent
desire was the sharpest and coldest blade that
pierced his heart. Vainly did he appeal to his
reason; of what account was his reason? He
was quite as much of a child as the little one
asleep in the coffin, for he gave greater importance
to a toy just then than to anything else
on earth or in heaven.</p>


<h3>VI.</h3>

<p>The moans of despair at last died away in the
house, as if grief, piercing its way into the very
depths of the soul, which is its natural dwelling-place,
had closed after it the windows of the
senses, so as to be alone and luxuriate in
itself.</p>

<p>This was Christmas Eve; and while stillness
reigned in the home so recently visited by
death, from all the other houses and from the
streets of the city came the joyous roar of rude
musical instruments and the clamorous voices of
children and adults singing the advent of the
Messiah. The shouts from the flat above could
be heard in the very parlor where the dead<span
class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
child lay; and the pious women who sat with her
were perturbed in their sorrow and their devout
meditation. On the upper floor many small
children, with a still greater number of large
ones, happy papas and mammas, excited aunts
and uncles, were celebrating Christmas and were
going mad with delight before the most admirable
Bethlehem manger that was ever dreamed
of and the most luxuriant tree that ever grew
toys and sweetmeats, and which bore on its
limbs a thousand lighted tapers. The parlor
ceiling seemed to shake under the great commotion;
the poor little corpse quivered in its blue
coffin; and all the lights in the room oscillated
as though they wished to proclaim that they too
were somewhat tipsy. Two of the good women
retired; one alone remained, but her head felt
very heavy, no doubt because she had lost so
much sleep on the preceding nights; so after
a little her chin sank on her breast and everything
melted from her consciousness.</p>

<p>The lights continued to waver, although there
was no draught in the room. One might have
believed that invisible wings were fluttering
about the altar. The lace on Celinina's gown
rose and fell; and the petals of her artificial
flowers betrayed the passage of a playful breeze,
or the soft touch of tender hands. Just then
Celinina opened her eyes. They filled the<span
class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
room with bright inquiring glances cast down
and up and around her. She instantly unclasped
her hands, the ribbon that bound them together
offering no resistance; and closing her little fists,
she rubbed both eyes as children do when they
awake. Then with a quick movement, and
without the slightest effort, she sat up, and looking
upward at the ceiling, she began to laugh,&mdash;a
peculiar inaudible laugh apparent to the eyes
alone. The one sound that reached the ear
was the rapid beating of wings, as if all the
doves of the earth were flying in and out of the
death-chamber, brushing their feathers against
the walls and ceiling. Then Celinina rose to
her feet, stretched out her arms, and two short
white wings sprouted from her shoulders. They
flapped and beat for a few seconds; then she
rose in the air and disappeared.</p>

<p>In the parlor everything remained as it was;
the lights glowed on the altar, pouring copious
streams of melted wax on the <i>bobeches</i>. The
images all stood in their places without moving
an arm or a leg or unsealing their austere lips.
The good woman was plunged in a profound
sleep which must have been a special blessing to
her. Nothing had changed, except that the
little blue coffin had been left empty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span></p>


<h3>VII.</h3>

<p>What a royal celebration at the home of the
Señores of &mdash;&mdash; to-night! The house is filled
with the thunder of drums. Children cannot be
made to understand that they might enjoy things
a great deal more if they only omitted the infernal
noise of the warlike instrument. But this is not
all. In order that no human tympanum may be
left in condition to perform its natural functions
the next day, they have added to the drum the
thumping of the <i>zambomba</i>,&mdash;that hellish contrivance
whose sounds were intended to reproduce
the growls of Satan. The symphony is
completed by the tambourine, which, like the
rattling of old tin pans, would irritate the most
placid nerves; and still this discordant hubbub
without rhythm or melody, more primitive
than the music of savages, is inspiriting and
cheerful on this particular night, and bears something
of a distant likeness to a celestial choir.</p>

<p>The Bethlehem manger is not a work of art
to the adults; but to the children the figures
are so beautiful, there is such a mystic expression
on their countenances and so much propriety
in their costumes, that they scarcely
believe them to be the work of human hands,
and are inclined to lay it all to the industry of a<span
class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
certain class of angels who make a living by
working in clay. The entrance of the stable,
carved out of cork, and imitating a partly ruined
Roman arch, is a dream of beauty; and the little
river made of looking-glass, with its green spots
representing aquatic growths and the moss of
its banks, seems really to be rippling along
the table with a soft murmur. The bridge over
which the shepherds are coming is a masterpiece.
Never before was pasteboard known to
look so exactly like stone,&mdash;a striking contrast
this to the works of our modern engineers, who
build bridges of stone, that look exactly like
pasteboard. The mountain that rises in the
centre of the landscape might be taken for a
scrap of the Pyrenees; and its exquisite cottages,
a trifle smaller than the figures, and its
mimic trees with little limbs of real foliage are
far more real than Nature.</p>

<p>But the most attractive, the most characteristic
figures are those on the plain,&mdash;the washerwomen
washing clothes at the stream; the
chicken and turkey tenders driving their flocks
before them; then an officer of the civil guards
taking two scamps off to jail; gentlemen riding
in luxurious carriages, brushing past the camel
of the Magi; and Perico, the blind man, playing
on the guitar to a little group of people through
which the shepherds have elbowed their way on<span
class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
their return from their worship at the manger.
A tram-car runs along from one extremity of the
landscape to the other, just exactly as it does in
the Salamanca quarter; and as it has wheels and
real tracks, it is kept going from east to west,
much to the surprise of the black Magi, who
cannot make out what sort of a machine it can
possibly be.</p>

<p>The arch opens upon a beautiful square, in
the centre of which stands a little glass aquarium.
A short distance away a newsboy is
selling papers, and two Majos are dancing prettily.
The capital pieces of this marvellous people
of clay, those upon which all eyes are
centred, are the fritter-vender and the old woman
selling chestnuts on the street corner;
and the children fairly split their sides at the
sight of the small ragamuffin, who holds out a
lottery ticket to the old chestnut woman, while
with the other hand he quietly pilfers her nuts.</p>

<p>In a word, there is no Bethlehem manger in
all Madrid that can be compared to this one;
for this is one of the great homes of the capital,
and the parlors are crowded with the best-bred
and most beautiful children to be found within
a radius of twenty streets.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span></p>


<h3>VIII.</h3>

<p>And how about the tree? The tree is composed
of oak and cedar limbs. The solicitous
friend of the family who expended no small
amount of patience and ingenuity in its construction
declares that a more finished and perfect
piece of work never left his hands. It
would be impossible to count the presents that
dangle from its branches. According to the
computation of a small boy present, they are
more numerous than the grains of sand on the
seashore. There are sweetmeats nestling in
shells of frilled paper, mandarins which are the
wee babes of the oranges, chestnuts draped in
mantillas of silver paper, tiny boxes containing
bonbons of hom&oelig;opathic proportions, figures of
every variety, on foot and on horseback,&mdash;in a
word, everything that God ever created with a
view to its being perfected later on by the confectioner
or sold by Scropp, has been put here
by hands which are as liberal as they are skilful.
This tree of life is illumined by such an abundance
of little wax tapers that according to the
testimony of a four-year-old guest there were
more lights there than the stars in heaven. The
delight of this youthful swarm is not comparable
to any human sentiment. It is the ineffable joy<span
class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
of the celestial choirs in presence of the Supreme
Good and Supreme Beauty. They are
almost reasonable in their overflowing satisfaction;
and they stand half perplexed in a seraphic
ecstasy, with their whole soul in their eyes, anticipating
all that they are going to eat, floating
like angels of heaven in the pure ether of sweet
and delicious things, in the perfume of flowers
and cinnamon, in the increate essence of youthful
greediness and play.</p>


<h3>IX.</h3>

<p>But they are suddenly startled by a sound
which does not proceed from them. They all
look up at the ceiling; and as they see nothing
there, they all look at one another again and begin
to laugh. A great rushing sound is heard,&mdash;the
rustle of wings as they brush against the
walls and strike the ceiling. Had they been
blind, they might have believed that all the
doves from all the dovecots in the universe
had gotten into the parlor. But they saw nothing;
that is, no wings, absolutely none. What
they did see, however, was phenomenal and
inexplicable enough in itself. All the figures of
the Bethlehem manger began to move; they
were all very quietly being changed around.
The tram-car made an ascension to the very<span
class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
pinnacle of the mountain; and the Magi walked
straight into the river on all fours. The turkeys
passed under the arch and entered the stable
without saying by your leave; and Saint Joseph
stepped out in a state of perplexity, trying to
make out what could be the cause of such extraordinary
confusion. Then a number of figures
were very coolly tumbled off on the floor.
At first they had been moved about very carefully,
but suddenly there was a great stir, then
a perfect hurly-burly, in which a hundred thousand
busy hands seemed eager to turn every
thing topsy-turvy. It was a miniature of the
universal cataclysm. Its secular cement giving
way, the mountain was levelled; the river changed
its course; and scattering the broken bits of mirror
from its bed, it overflowed the plain disastrously.
The very roofs of the cottages were
sunken in the sand. The Roman arch trembled
as though it were beaten by fierce winds; and
as a number of little lights went out, the sun
was obscured, and so were the luminaries of the
night. In the midst of the general stupor that
such a phenomenon naturally produced, some
of the little ones laughed wildly, while others
cried. A superstitious old lady said, "Don't
you know who is doing all this? Why, the
dead children who are in heaven and whom
Father God permits to come down on<span
class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
Christmas Eve and play with the Bethlehem
mangers."</p>

<p>After a little it was all over; the rushing
sound of beating wings grew fainter and fainter.
Many of those who were present proceeded
to investigate the damages. One gentleman
said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Why, the table has been broken down and
all the figures have been upset?" Then everybody
began to pick up the figures and put them
in their places. After counting them over and
identifying them, it was found that some were
missing. They looked everywhere, and looked
again, but to no effect. There were two figures
wanting,&mdash;the Mule and the Ox.</p>


<h3>X.</h3>

<p>Just a little before dawn the disturbers were
on the road to heaven, as merry as crickets,
frisking and skipping about among the clouds.
There were millions and millions of them, all
beautiful, pure, divine, with short white wings
beating faster than those of the swiftest birds on
earth.</p>

<p>This white swarm was greater than anything
that the eye can focus in visible space, and it
spread over the moon and the stars, and the firmament
seemed filled with little fleecy clouds.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span></p>

<p>"Hurry, hurry, my dears!" said a voice
among them; "the first thing you know it will
be day, and Grandpapa God will scold us for
being late. If the truth must be told, the Bethlehem
mangers this year are not worth a penny.
When I recall those of former times&mdash;" Celinina
was one of this merry throng, but as this was her
first experience in those altitudes, she felt somewhat
giddy.</p>

<p>"Come over here," one of them cried to her;
"give me your hand, and you will fly straighter&mdash;but
what is that? What have you there?"</p>

<p>"'Em's my sings," said Celinina, pressing two
rude little clay figures to her bosom.</p>

<p>"Listen, my dear, throw those away. It is
very evident that you are just from the earth.
Let me tell you how it is. Although we have
all the toys we want in heaven,&mdash;eternal and
ever-beautiful toys,&mdash;Grandpapa God lets us
go down on Christmas Eve just to stir up the
Bethlehem mangers a little. You needn't think
they are not having a glorious time in heaven too
to-night; and for my part, I believe they send
us off on account of our being so noisy. But
Grandpapa God lets us go down into the houses
only on condition that we take away nothing,
and here you have pilfered this!"</p>

<p>These weighty reasons did not seem to impress
Celinina as they should have done, for<span
class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
pressing the animals more closely to her bosom,
she merely repeated,&mdash;</p>

<p>"My sings,&mdash;'em's my sings."</p>

<p>"Listen, goosy," continued the other; "if you
don't do what I tell you, you'll get us all into
trouble. Fly back and leave them, for they are
of the earth, and on the earth they should remain.
Don't be foolish; you can go and be
back in less than a minute. I'll wait for you
on this cloud."</p>

<p>Celinina was at last convinced and started off
to restore her theft to the earth.</p>


<h3>XI.</h3>

<p>This is how it came to pass that Celinina's
corpse, that which had been her visible self, was
found the next morning holding two little clay
animals instead of the bunch of artificial flowers.
No one could solve the mystery, not even the
women who kept watch, nor the father, nor the
mother; and the beautiful little girl, for whom
so many tears were shed, went down into the
earth clasping the Mule and the Ox in her cold
little hands.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">All</span>
that afternoon we had
walked through the forest,
stick in hand, our bags
slung over our shoulders,
through that magnificent
forest of Tronsays, which
covers one half the St.
Amand country, and one half of Nevers. The
little village of Ursay, squatting on the bank of
the Cher, in the rent of the valley which cuts
through the centre of the forest, was our last
halting-place for the day. We dined with an
old friend, the modest doctor of five or six neighboring
communes; and after dinner we sat musing
on the stoop, with our cherry pipes between
our lips.</p>

<p>The shadows fell around us, over the dense
blue mass of forest that encircled the horizon
with all the solemn slowness of night in June.
The sky was streaked with flights of swallows.
The nine o'clock Angelus scattered its notes<span
class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
with intervals of silence from the height of a
snuffer-like steeple which emerged from among
the roofs. From distant farms came the barking
of dogs calling and answering one another.</p>

<p>A woman, still young, in a red woollen skirt
and a white linen shirt, came out of a house
near by, and walked down toward the river.
With her left arm she pressed a baby against her
bosom. A little boy held her other hand, and
gave his in turn to a still smaller brother. When
they reached the bank of the Cher, the young
woman sat upon a great stone; and while the
two boys, hastily undressed, were paddling and
splashing about like ducks in the stream, she
nursed her last-born.</p>

<p>One of our party, who was a painter, said,
"There is a picture that would be popular at
the Salon. How splendidly built and well-lighted
that woman is! And what a pretty bright spot
that red skirt forms in the blue landscape!"</p>

<p>A voice behind us called out,&mdash;</p>

<p>"The girl you see there, young men, is Solange,
the wolf-girl." And our host, who had
been detained by a consultation, came out to
join us. As we asked him who was this wolf-girl,
and how she had come by so strange a nickname,
he told us this story,&mdash;</p>

<p>"This Solange, the wolf-girl, whose real name
is Solange Tournier, wife of Grillet, was the prettiest<span
class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
girl in the whole Tronsays country about
ten years ago. Now, of course, working in the
fields as she does, and having had five children,
she looks hardened and worn. Still, considering
her thirty years, she is handsome enough, as you
see. At the time of the adventure whence she
derived her strange nickname she was living with
her parents, who were farmers of the Rein-du-Bois,
some fifteen kilometres from here. Although
very poor, she was much sought by all
the boys, even by the well-to-do; but she accepted
the addresses of only one,&mdash;a certain
Laurent Grillet, on whom she had set her heart
when she was a wee bit of a girl, when the two
kept the sheep together in the neighborhood of
Rein-du-Bois.</p>

<p>"Laurent Grillet was a foundling, who had
nothing in the world but his two arms for a fortune.
Solange's parents felt no inclination to
add poverty to poverty, especially as the girl
had so many wealthy suitors.</p>

<p>"So Solange was forbidden to see her friend.
Naturally, the girl never failed at a tryst. Living
in the same commune, with the forest at
hand, they never lost an opportunity of meeting
there. When the father and mother Tournier
realized that scoldings and blows were of no
avail, they determined upon a radical step.
Solange was accordingly sent out to work at<span
class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
Ursay, on the model farm of M. Roger Duflos,
our deputy.</p>

<p>"Perhaps you think our two lovers ceased to
see each other. Not in the least. They now
met at night; they slept no more. After nightfall
they both left the farms where they were employed
and started toward each other; and then
they remained together until nearly dawn in the
maternal forest, the accomplice of their young
love.</p>

<p>"This was in 1879. In this manner the summer
and autumn went by. Then came the winter,
and a fierce winter it was. The Cher carried
ice-drifts, and finally froze from bank to
bank. The Tronsays forests, covered with snow,
were bent like the weak supports of an overladen
roof. The roads were almost impassable.
The forest, deserted by man, was gradually being
reconquered by beasts. It was soon invaded by
wolves, which had neither been seen nor heard
of since the Terrible year.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, wolves! They haunted the isolated
farms around Lurcy-Lévy and Ursay. They
even ventured into the streets of St. Bonnet le
Désert,&mdash;a little village in the heart of the forest
on the banks of a pond. It reached such a point
that men were organized into bands to beat the
woods. A reward of fifty francs was offered for
the head of a wolf.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span></p>

<p>"Neither winter nor wolves, however, daunted
Solange and Laurent, or interfered with their
nocturnal meetings. They continued their expeditions
in the face of a thousand dangers. This
was the dead season in the fields, the time when
the land lies fallow. Every night Laurent left
Lurcy-Lévy, a gun over his shoulder, and penetrated
with a lively step into the black and white
forest. Solange, on the other hand, started from
Ursay at about nine o'clock, and they met near a
glade some three kilometres from here, traversed
by a road, and known as the Découverte.</p>

<p>"It so happened that one night, which, by the
way, was Christmas Eve, Laurent Grillet, as he
reached the rendezvous, slipped on the hardened
snow and fell, breaking his right leg and spraining
his right wrist. Solange tried to raise him,
but could only drag him to a great elm, against
which she propped him, after wrapping him in
her own cloak.</p>

<p>"'Wait for me here, my poor Laurent,' said
she; 'I will run to Ursay for the doctor, and get
him to come for you in his carryall.'</p>

<p>"She started off, but had not reached the first
turn in the road when she heard a report and
the cry, 'Help!'</p>

<p>"She ran back and found her friend in an
agony of pain and fear, his trembling hand on<span
class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
the gun which lay beside him. She said, 'What
is it, Laurent? Was it you who fired?'</p>

<p>"He answered, 'It was I. I saw a beast about
the size of a large dog, and with great red eyes.
I believe, on my word, it was a wolf.'</p>

<p>"'Was it at him you fired?'</p>

<p>"'No. I cannot lift my gun on account of
my arm. I fired on the ground to scare him.
He has gone now.'</p>

<p>"Solange reflected for a moment. 'Will he
come back?'</p>

<p>"'I am afraid he will,' answered the lad.
'Solange, you will have to stay, or that beast will
eat me.'</p>

<p>"'Well,' she said, 'I will stay. Let me have
the gun.'</p>

<p>"She took it, put in a fresh cartridge, and
they both waited.</p>

<p>"An hour passed. The moon, as yet invisible,
had risen, however, above the horizon, for the
zenith reflected a confused light, which was
gradually growing more intense. Laurent felt
the fever coming upon him. He shivered and
moaned. Solange, half frozen, as she stood
leaning against the tree, was beginning to feel
drowsy. Suddenly a bark&mdash;a sort of howl like
that of a dog at night when it is tied&mdash;made her
start. In the faint light she saw two red eyes
fixed upon her. It was the wolf. Laurent tried<span
class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
to rise and take his gun, but the pain flung him
back with a cry.</p>

<p>"'Load, Solange,' said he. 'Do not fire too
soon, and aim between the eyes.'</p>

<p>"She shouldered, aimed, and fired, but the
gun recoiled and missed aim. The beast was untouched.
It ran off a short way down the road.
Then it was heard howling at a distance, and
other howls came in answer.</p>

<p>"The moon was climbing the sky. It suddenly
passed the dark mass of the thickets and
flooded the entire forest as the footlights illumine
the scenery on the stage. Then Solange and
Laurent saw this horrible sight: at a few feet
from them five wolves were seated on their
haunches, drawn in line across the road, while
another, bolder than the rest, was walking slowly
toward them.</p>

<p>"'Listen,' said Laurent. 'Aim at that one
that is coming. If you bring him down, the
others will eat him, and they will leave us in
peace in the mean time.'</p>

<p>"The wolf continued to advance with short,
cautious steps. They could now see his bloodshot
eyeballs distinctly, the protruding rings of
his spine, the sharp bones of his carcass, his dull
hair and his open jaw, with the long tongue
hanging out. 'Hold the butt-end well in the
hollow of your shoulder. Now fire.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span></p>

<p>"There was a report; the beast leaped to one
side and fell dead without a groan. The whole
band galloped off and disappeared in the copse.</p>

<p>"'Run, Solange!' cried Laurent; 'drag him
as far as you can along the road. There is no
danger; the others will not come back for a
while yet.'</p>

<p>"She had started, when he called her back.
'It might be just as well to cut off that beast's
head on account of the reward.'</p>

<p>"'Have you a knife?' asked Solange.</p>

<p>"'Yes; in my belt.'</p>

<p>"It was a short-handled, broad-bladed hunter's
knife. She took it and ran to the dead
wolf. She made a great effort and drove it in his
throat, the warm blood trickling down her hands
and along her skirt; she turned her knife around,
cut deep, then hacked, and finally severed the
head from the trunk, which she dragged by one
leg over the slippery snow as far as she could.
Then she returned to her lover with the bloody,
bristly head of the beast in her hand.</p>

<p>"What Laurent had foreseen occurred. The
wolves, at first frightened by the death of their
leader, were soon brought back by the smell of
the blood. In the white light of the moon, reflected
by the snow like the fantastic light of a
fairy scene, the two young people saw the group
of lean, ravenous beasts rubbing their backs<span
class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
against one another, crowding around the fresh
prey, tearing it limb from limb, growling and
snarling over it, wrenching off the flesh, until
nothing was left of it, not even a tuft of hair.</p>

<p>"Meanwhile the boy was suffering greatly from
his injuries. Solange, whose nerves were beginning
to relax, struggled vainly against exhaustion
and sleep. Twice her gun fell from her hands.
The wolves, having finished their meal, began to
draw nearer. The girl fired twice in the lot, but
her benumbed fingers trembled and she missed
her aim. At each report the band turned tail,
trotted about a hundred metres down the road,
waited a moment and came back.</p>

<p>"Then the two poor children were convinced
that it was all over with them, and that they
must die. Solange dropped her gun. It never
once occurred to her that she might save herself.
She threw herself down beside her lover,
clasped her arms around him, laid her cheek
against his, and there under the same cloak
they awaited death, half frozen with the cold,
half burning with fever. Their confused brains
conjured strange visions. Now they thought
they had gone back to the balmy nights of June
when the forest, clad in deep green, sheltered
their peaceful meetings, then suddenly the wood
was bare, lighted with a weird snowy light,
peopled with shifting forms, eyes like burning<span
class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
embers, great open jaws that multiplied, and
came nearer, ever nearer.</p>

<p>"But neither Solange nor Laurent was destined
to die so horrible a death. Providence&mdash;yes,
young men, I believe in a Providence&mdash;had
decreed that I, on that Christmas morning,
should find myself on that particular road on
my way home in my carryall from St. Bonnet
le Désert. I managed the lines; my man held
the gun and inspected the road. No doubt our
sleigh-bells frightened away the wolves, for we
saw none. As we drove near the elm at the
foot of which the lovers lay, my mare shied, and
so drew our attention to them. I jumped down
from the seat. My man and I settled them in
the carryall as best as we could, covering them
with what wraps we had along. They were unconscious
and almost frozen. We took the
bloody head of the wolf with us too.</p>

<p>"It was about seven o'clock in the morning
when we reached Ursay. The day was breaking
over a landscape of spun glass and white
velvet. M. Roger Duflos' farmers and at
least one half of the inhabitants of the borough,
having heard of Solange's disappearance, came
out to meet us; and in the very kitchen where
we dined this evening, in front of a great fire of
crackling heather, Laurent and his friend warmed
themselves and told us the story of their terrible
Christmas."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span></p>

<p>One of us said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"And what followed, Doctor? Did they
marry?"</p>

<p>"Yes; they were married," answered our host.
"The will of Providence is sometimes so plainly
indicated by events that the most obtuse cannot
fail to perceive it. After the adventure with the
wolves, Solange's parents consented to her marriage
with Laurent Grillet. The marriage took
place in the spring. The reward of fifty francs
for the wolf's head paid for the wedding dress."</p>

<p>The doctor was silent. Night was full upon
us. The sky, of a turquoise blue, reflected its
first stars in the river. The mass of forest, dense
and inky, shut off the horizon. We saw Solange,
the wolf-girl, dress her two boys and start homeward
with them, the youngest asleep on her
shoulder. She passed very near us, and looking
up, smiled at the doctor. The doctor said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Good-night, Solange!"</p>

<h3>I.</h3>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">It</span>
was Christmas Eve in a
great Bavarian town. A
joyous crowd pushed its
way through the streets
white with snow, in the
confusion of the fog, the
rumble of carriages, and
the clamor of bells, toward
the booths, stalls,
and cook-shops in the open air. Great fir-trees
bedecked with dangling gewgaws were being
carried about, grazing the ribbons and flowers of
the booths and towering above the crowd like
shadows of Thuringian forests,&mdash;a breath of
Nature in the artificial life of winter.</p>

<p>It is twilight. The lingering lights of sunset,
sending a crimson glow through the fog, can still
be seen from the gardens beyond the Residence;
and in the town the very air is so full of animation
and festivity that every light which blinks
through a window-pane seems to be dangling<span
class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
from a Christmas-tree. For this is not an ordinary
Christmas. It is the year of our Lord
1870; and the birth of Christ is but an additional
pretext for drinking the health of the illustrious
Von der Than, and celebrating the triumph of
Bavarian warriors. Christmas! Christmas! The
Jews of the lower town themselves have joined
in the general merriment. Here comes old
Augustus Cahn, hurrying around the corner of
"The Bunch of Blue Grapes." There is an unusual
light in his ferret eyes. His little bushy
pigtail was never known to wriggle so merrily.
Over his sleeve, worn shiny by the rope handles
of his wallet, he carries an honest basket, quite
full, covered with a brown linen napkin, from
under which peep the neck of a bottle and a
twig of holly.</p>

<p>What the deuce is the old usurer up to?
Can he too be celebrating Christmas? Has he
assembled his friends and family to drink to the
Vaterland? Impossible. Everybody knows that
old Cahn has no Fatherland but his money-safe.
Neither has he relatives nor friends; he has only
creditors. His sons, or rather his partners, have
been away for three months with the army.
They are trading yonder behind the luggage-vans
of the landwehr, selling brandy, buying
clocks, ripping the knapsacks fallen by the wayside,
and searching the pockets of the dead at<span
class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
night on the battle-field. Father Cahn, too old
to follow his children, has remained in Bavaria,
where he is doing a flourishing business with the
French prisoners. He hovers about the quarters,
loans money on watches, buys epaulets,
medals, and money-orders. He ferrets his way
through hospitals and ambulances, and creeps
noiselessly to the bedside of the wounded, inquiring
in his hideous jargon,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Aff you zumting to zell?"</p>

<p>And now he is trotting along hurriedly with
his basket on his arm, because the military hospital
closes at five, and because two Frenchmen
are waiting for him there, in that great gloomy
building behind the iron grating of narrow windows,
where Christmas finds nothing to cheer its
vigil but the pale lamps that burn at the bedside
of the dying.</p>


<h3>II.</h3>

<p>These two Frenchmen are Salvette and Bernadou,
two light-infantry men, two Provençals from
the same village, enlisted in the same battalion
and wounded by the same shell. But Salvette
has proved the hardier of the two; he is able
now to get up and to take a few steps from his bed
to the window. Bernadou, on the other hand,
has no desire to recover. Behind the faded<span
class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
curtains of his hospital bed, he languishes and
grows thinner day by day; and when he speaks
of his home, he smiles that sad smile of invalids
which contains more resignation than hope.
He seems a little brighter to-day, however, as
he recalls the celebration of Christmas, which
in our beautiful land of Provence is like a bonfire
lighted in the heart of winter. He thinks
of the walk home after midnight Mass, of the
bedecked and luminous churches, the dark and
crowded village streets, then the long evening
around the table, the three traditional torches,
the <i>aïoli</i>, the dish of snails, the pretty ceremony
of the <i>cacho fio</i>,&mdash;the Yule log, which the grandfather
parades through the house and sprinkles
with mulled wine.</p>

<p>"Ah, my poor Salvette, what a dreary Christmas
this will be! If we only had a few cents
left, we could buy a little loaf of white bread and
a bottle of light wine. It would be nice to sprinkle
the Yule log with you once more before&mdash;"
And his sunken eyes shine when he thinks
of the wine and the white bread. But what is
to be done? They have nothing left, the poor
wretches,&mdash;no watches, no money. True,
Salvette has a money-order for forty francs
stored away in the lining of his vest. But that
must be kept in reserve for the day of their release,
or rather for the first halt at a French<span
class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
inn. It is sacred money, and cannot be touched.
Still, poor Bernadou is so low, who can tell
whether he will ever live through the journey
home? And while it is still time, might it not
be better to celebrate this Christmas together?
Without saying a word of it to his comrade,
Salvette rips his vest lining; and after a long
struggle and a whispered discussion with Augustus
Cahn, he slips into his hand this little
scrap of stiff yellow paper smelling of powder
and stained with blood, after which he assumes
a look of deep mystery. He rubs his hands
and laughs softly to himself as he glances over
at Bernadou. As the darkness falls, he stands
with his forehead against the window-pane, and
stirs from his post only when he sees old Augustus
Cahn turn the corner breathlessly, with a
little basket on his arm.</p>


<h3>III.</h3>

<p>The solemn midnight, ringing from all the
steeples of the great city, falls lugubriously on
the insomnia of the wounded. The hospital is
silent, lighted only by the night lamps that
swing from the ceiling. Gaunt shadows float
over the beds and the bare walls with a perpetual
swaying, which seems like the oppressed
breathing of the people lying there. Every now<span
class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
and then there are dreams which talk aloud, or
nightmares that moan; while vague murmurs of
steps and voices, blended in the sonorous chill
of the night, rise from the street like sounds issuing
from the portals of a cathedral. They are
fraught with impressions of pious haste,&mdash;the
mystery of a religious festival invading the hours
of sleep and filling the darkness of the city with
the soft glow of lanterns and the jewelled radiance
of church windows.</p>

<p>"Are you asleep, Bernadou?"</p>

<p>On the little table by his friend's bed Salvette
has laid a bottle of Lunel wine and a pretty
round Christmas loaf with a twig of holly stuck
in the top. The wounded man opens his eyes,
dark and sunken with fever. In the uncertain
light of the night lamps and the reflection of the
long roofs, where the moon dazzles herself in the
snow, this improvised Christmas supper strikes
him as something fantastic.</p>

<p>"Come, wake up, countryman; let it not be
said that two Provençals let Christmas go by
without sprinkling it with a draught of wine&mdash;"
And Salvette raises him on his pillows with a
mother's tenderness. He fills the glasses, cuts
the bread. They drink and speak of Provence.
Bernadou seems to be cheered by the reminiscences
and the white wine. With that childishness
which invalids seem to find again in the<span
class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
depths of their weakness he begs for a Provençal
carol. His comrade is only too happy.</p>

<p>"What shall it be,&mdash;'The Host' or 'The
Three Kings' or 'Saint Joseph told me'?"</p>

<p>"No; I prefer 'The Shepherds.' That is the
one we used to sing at home."</p>

<p>"Very well, then. Here goes, 'The Shepherds.'"</p>

<p>And in a low voice, with his head under the
bed-curtains, Salvette begins to sing. At the
last verse, when the shepherds have laid down
their offering of fresh eggs and cheeses, and
Saint Joseph speeds them with kind words,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry">
  <p class="i1">"Shepherds,</p>
  <p>Take your leave,"&mdash;</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">poor Bernadou slips back and falls heavily on
his pillow.</p>

<p>His comrade, who believes that he has gone
to sleep again, shakes him by the arm and calls
him; but the wounded man remains motionless,
and the twig of holly lying beside him looks like
the green palm that is laid on the couch of the
dead. Salvette has understood; he is slightly
tipsy with the celebration and the shock of his
sorrow; and with a voice full of tears he sings
out, filling the silent dormitory with the joyous
refrain of Provence,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry">
  <p class="i1">"Shepherds,</p>
  <p>Take your leave."</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Do</span>
you see the one with
the scarlet cloak and the
white plume in his hat,&mdash;the
one whose jerkin
seems to glitter with
all the gold of the Indian
galleys? He is
stepping from his litter;
he gives his hand to
that lady, see her! She is coming this way now,
preceded by four pages bearing torches. Well,
that is the Marquis of Moscoso, the lover of the
widowed Countess of Villapiñeda. They say
that before he thought of paying his addresses
to her he had sought the hand of an opulent
gentleman's daughter. But the lady's father,
whom people say is something of a miser&mdash;but
hush! speaking of the Devil. Do you see that
man coming through the arch of San Felipe, on
foot, muffled in a dark cloak, and accompanied<span
class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
by a single servant carrying a lantern? Now he
is in front of the street shrine.</p>

<p>"As he unmuffled to bow before the image,
did you notice the decoration that shone on his
breast? But for that noble insignia any one
would mistake him for a shopkeeper of the
street of the Culebras. Well, that is the father
in question. See how the people make way for
him and greet him as he goes by!</p>

<p>"Everybody knows him in Seville on account
of his great fortune. Why, he has more ducats
in his coffers than there are soldiers in King
Philip's armies; and his galleys would form a
fleet mighty enough to oppose the Sultan himself.
Look, look at that stately group of men!
They are the Twenty-four, the gentlemen of the
Aldermanry. Aha! and we have the great Fleming
among us too! They say that the gentlemen
of the green cross have not challenged him,
thanks to his influence among the magnates of
Madrid. He only comes to church to hear the
music; and if Maese Pérez does not bring
tears as big as one's fist to his eyes, it will no
doubt be because his soul, instead of being
where it belongs, is frying somewhere in the
Devil's caldron.</p>

<p>"Ah, neighbor, but this looks bad. I greatly
fear there is going to be trouble. I shall take
refuge in the church, for I judge there will be<span
class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
more broadswords than <i>Pater-nosters</i> in the air.
Look, look! the Duke of Alcalá's people have
turned the corner of the Plaza San Pedro, and
I fancy I see the Duke of Medina-Sidonia's men
emerging from the Alley of the Dueñas. What
did I tell you? They have caught sight of one
another; they stop; the groups are breaking up;
and the minstrels, who on these occasions are
generally beaten by friends and foes alike, are
running; the officer of justice himself, with the
emblem of authority and all, has taken refuge
under the portico,&mdash;and then people speak of
justice! Justice! yes,&mdash;for the poor.</p>

<p>"Come! the shields are beginning to glitter.
Lord of the great power, assist us! The blows
are falling thick and fast. Neighbor, neighbor,
this way before they close the doors! But wait,
what do I see? They have left off before they
had really begun. What is that light? A litter,
torches! It is the bishop, on my soul!</p>

<p>"Our Most Holy Lady of Protection, whom I
was just invoking inwardly, has sent him to our
rescue. Ah, nobody will ever know what the
great lady has done for me! With what interest
am I repaid for the tapers that I burn before
her every Saturday!</p>

<p>"See him; how handsome he is in his purple
robes and his scarlet cap! God keep him in
his episcopal chair as many centuries as I would<span
class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
like to live myself! Were it not for him, half
Seville would be ablaze with these dissensions
of the dukes. Look at them, the great hypocrites;
see how they all press around the prelate's
litter to kiss his ring. They all accompany
him, confounding themselves with his servants.
Who would believe that those two, who seem so
friendly in his presence, would if they came
together in a half-hour from now in some dark
street,&mdash;that is&mdash;who knows? I would not
accuse them of cowardice; God forbid! They
have given proof of their valor by fighting the
enemies of the Lord. Still, to speak the truth, it
seems to me that if they started out really determined
to settle their differences,&mdash;you understand
me, really determined,&mdash;it would be no
difficult matter, and they would thus put an end
to these continuous quarrels where the only ones
that give and take the blows are their kinsmen,
their allies, and their servants.</p>

<p>"But come, neighbor, come into the church
before the crowd fills it from end to end; for
on nights like this it is sometimes packed so full
that you could not squeeze in a grain of wheat.
The nuns have a prize in their organist. When
was the convent ever as favored as it is now?
Other sisterhoods have made Maese Pérez magnificent
offers,&mdash;which is not at all to be wondered
at, for the archbishop himself offered him<span
class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
mountains of gold if he would go to the cathedral.
But it was all of no use. He would
sooner give up his life than his beloved organ.
Do you not know Maese Pérez? To be sure,
you have not been long in the neighborhood.
Well, he is a saintly man, poor, no doubt, but a
man who never wearies of giving. With no
relative but his daughter, and no friend but his
organ, he spends his life caring for the one and
repairing the other.</p>

<p>"And the organ is an old one, let me tell you;
but that makes no difference to him. He takes
such pains with it and keeps it in such good
order that its tone is a perfect wonder. He
knows it so well that he can tell merely by the
touch&mdash;I do not know whether I told you that
the poor man was born blind. And how patiently
he bears his misfortune! When anybody
asks him how much he would give to be
able to see, he answers, 'A great deal, but not
as much as you think, for I have hope.'
'Hope of seeing?' 'Yes, and very soon too,'
he adds, smiling like an angel. 'I am seventy-six
years old, and however long the life allotted
to me, I must soon see God.' Poor man! yes,
he will see God, for he is as humble as the
stones of the street, that allow everybody to
tread upon them. He always says that he is
nothing but a poor convent organist, while he<span
class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
might teach solfeggio to the chapel master of
the cathedral himself. Of course he could; he
cut his teeth in the trade. His father before
him had the same position. I did not know
him, but my mother&mdash;may she rest in glory!&mdash;used
to say that he always brought the child
with him to pump the organ. Later on, the
boy showed great talent; and when his father
died, he naturally enough fell heir to his position.
And what hands he has, God bless them!
They are worthy of being taken to Chicarreros
Street to be set in pure gold. He always plays
well, always; but, my dear, on a night like this he
is a perfect wonder. He professes the greatest
devotion to this ceremony of midnight Mass,
and at the elevation of the Sacred Form, precisely
at twelve o'clock, which is the time when
our Lord came into the world, the voices of his
organ are the real voices of angels.</p>

<p>"But what is the use of telling you about what
you will hear for yourself in a few moments?
Just notice the people who are here to-night, and
you will form some idea of what he is. Here
is all the elegance of Seville, and the archbishop
himself,&mdash;all come to this humble convent
to hear him play. It is not only the learned
people, those who know music, who understand
his merit; not so,&mdash;the very rabble appreciate
him. This great crowd that you see coming<span
class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
this way with torches, singing carols with all the
might of their lungs to the accompaniment of
their tambourines and drums,&mdash;they are the kind
of people to create a disturbance in a church;
but just wait, they will be as still as the dead
when Maese Pérez lays his hands on the organ.
At the elevation of the Host, not a fly makes
itself heard. There are great tears in every
eye; and when the music stops, you hear something
like a deep sigh, which proves that the
people have been holding their breath in ecstasy
all the while. But come, come! the bells have
stopped ringing; and Mass will soon begin.
Let us go in. This is the good night of the
world, but for none will it be a better night than
for us."</p>

<p>And saying this, the good woman, who had
acted as her neighbor's cicerone, pressed through
the portico of the convent of Santa Inés, and
elbowing here, pushing there, made her way into
the interior of the temple, there losing herself in
the surging crowd.</p>


<h3>II.</h3>

<p>The church was profusely illumined. The
torrent of light which fell from the altars and
filled the edifice sparkled on the rich jewels of
the great ladies, who, kneeling on the velvet<span
class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
cushions which their pages laid at their feet, and
taking their missals from the hands of their
duennas, formed a brilliant circle around the
chancel grating. Behind them, in bright gold-embroidered
cloaks thrown back with studied
carelessness in order to display glittering orders
of green and red, their broad-brimmed felts in
one hand, the plumes sweeping the floor, the left
hand resting on the polished hilts of their rapiers
or caressing the pommel of their chiselled daggers,
stood the Twenty-four, who with a great
part of the best nobility of Seville seemed to
form a wall around their wives and daughters to
protect them from the contact of the populace.
The latter, moving about in the rear of the nave
with a murmur like that of a stormy sea, burst
into a jubilant acclamation, accompanied by the
discord of timbrels and tambourines, at the appearance
of the bishop. The prelate, surrounded
by his attendants, took his seat under a crimson
canopy, beside the high altar, and blessed the
people three times.</p>

<p>It was time for Mass to begin. Several minutes
elapsed, however, and the celebrant did
not appear. The crowd began to show evidences
of impatience; the knights exchanged
whispers among themselves; and the bishop sent
one of his attendants to the sacristy to inquire
into the cause of the delay.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span></p>

<p>"Maese Pérez has been taken ill, very ill;
and it will be impossible for him to attend Mass
to-night."</p>

<p>This was the word that the attendant brought
back.</p>

<p>The news spread through the church in an
instant. It produced a most unpleasant effect.
The noise was such in the temple that the chief
officer of justice rose to his feet, and the constables
entered the church to enforce silence.</p>

<p>At that moment an ill-looking man, ungainly,
bony, and cross-eyed to boot, stepped up to the
place where the prelate sat.</p>

<p>"Maese Pérez is ill," said he; "the ceremony
cannot begin. If you see fit, I will play
the organ in his absence, for Maese Pérez is not
the greatest organist in the world, nor will the
instrument fall into disuse after his death for
the lack of a musician to take his place."</p>

<p>The archbishop made a movement of assent;
and already some of the faithful, who knew this
individual to be an envious rival of the organist
of Santa Inés, were breaking into exclamations
of disgust when suddenly a great noise
was heard in the portico.</p>

<p>"Maese Pérez is here! Maese Pérez is
here!"</p>

<p>All heads were turned toward the crowded
doorways from which these shouts came.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span></p>

<p>In truth, Maese Pérez, pale and disfigured, was
entering the church, carried in an armchair, which
everybody claimed the honor of bearing upon
his shoulders. Neither the doctor's commands
nor his daughter's tears had been able to keep
him in bed.</p>

<p>"No," he had said; "this is the last&mdash;the
last&mdash;I know it. I will not die without hearing
the voice of my organ again, on this solemn
night, this good-night. Come, I implore, I command
you, let us go to the church!"</p>

<p>His desire was gratified. The people carried
him in their arms to the organ-loft. Mass
began.</p>

<p>The cathedral clock struck twelve. After the
introit came the Gospel, the offertory, then the
solemn moment when the priest, after having
consecrated the bread, takes the Sacred Form
between his fingers and begins to elevate it.
A cloud of incense in bluish waves floated
through the church. The little altar-bells began
to ring in vibrating peals, and Maese Pérez laid
his aged fingers upon the keys of the organ.</p>

<p>The multitudinous voices of its metal pipes resounded
in a prolonged and majestic chord,
which grew gradually fainter, as though the
breath of the wind had borne away its last
echoes.</p>

<p>The first chord, which seemed like a voice<span
class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
from the earth calling out to heaven, was answered
by another, that seemed to come from a
great distance, soft at first, then swelling until it
became a torrent of thundering harmony.</p>

<p>It was the voice of the angels, which had
traversed space and reached the earth.</p>

<p>Then followed what seemed like canticles
sung far away by the hierarchies of seraphim,
a thousand hymns at once blending into one,
which itself was no more than an accompaniment
for a strange melody that floated upon that
ocean of mysterious echoes as a mist floats over
the waves of the sea.</p>

<p>Then various chants dropped out of the harmony,
leaving two voices which finally melted
into each other; and this last isolated voice
lingered long, sustaining a note as brilliant as a
thread of light. The priest bent his brow, and
above his white head, through the blue gauzes of
the incense, he held up the Host to the eyes of
the faithful. At that moment the tremulous
note that Maese Pérez held swelled and swelled
until an immense explosion of joyous harmony
filled the church. In the far-off corners of the
temple the air seemed to buzz, and the jewel-windows
quivered in their tight frames. Each
one of the notes which formed the mighty chord
developed a theme of its own, some near, some
far, some brilliant, some muffled. It seemed as<span
class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
though the waters and the birds, the breezes and
the forests, heaven and earth, were each in its
own tongue singing the birth of the Saviour.</p>

<p>The crowd held its breath and listened,
amazed. There were tears in every eye, and
every heart was swelled with emotion. The
priest at the altar felt his hands tremble, for that
which he held in them&mdash;that before which men
and archangels bowed&mdash;was his God; and he
thought he saw the heavens opened and the
Host transfigured. After that the voices of the
organ gradually grew fainter like a sound that
dies as it is blown from echo to echo.</p>

<p>Suddenly, the cry of a woman, a piercing,
heart-rending cry, was heard in the organ-loft.
The organ exhaled a strange discord, something
like a sob, and was silent. The people rushed
to the stairs, toward which the faithful, drawn
from their religious ecstasy, had all turned their
gaze.</p>

<p>"What has happened? What is it?" whispered
they; but nobody knew what to answer,
and the confusion increased, threatening the
good order and pious stillness proper to a
church.</p>

<p>"What has happened?" inquired the great
ladies of the officer of justice, who, preceded
by the beadles, had first penetrated into the
organ-loft, and who now, pale and deeply distressed,<span
class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
was making his way to where the bishop
awaited him, anxious like the rest of the congregation
to learn the cause of the disturbance.</p>

<p>"What has happened?"</p>

<p>"Maese Pérez is dead!"</p>

<p>And so it was. Those who first reached the
organ-loft, jostling one another up the stairs, had
found the poor organist, fallen face downwards
on the keys of the old instrument, which was
still vibrating; while his daughter, kneeling at his
feet, was calling to him in vain with sobs and
cries.</p>


<h3>III.</h3>

<p>"Good-evening, my Señora Doña Baltasara;
are you here, too, for midnight Mass? For my
part I had intended going to the parish, but
you see how it is,&mdash;one goes where everybody
goes. And yet, to tell you the truth, since
Maese Pérez's death I feel as though there were
a tombstone on my heart every time I enter
Santa Inés. Poor dear man! Truly he was a
saint. I have a little scrap of his doublet which
I preserve like a relic, and which surely deserves
it; for I believe, by my soul, that if the archbishop
would only take a hand in the matter,
our grandchildren would see him canonized.
But why expect it? The dead and the absent
have no friends. Novelty is what is in favor<span
class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
now,&mdash;you understand me, of course. What!
You do not know what is going on? True, we
are alike in that respect,&mdash;from our house to
church, and from church back again, without
inquiring into what is said or what is not said.
However, on the wing, catching a word here, a
word there, without the least interest in the matter,
I sometimes happen to know the news.</p>

<p>"Well, yes, it seems to be a settled thing
that the organist of
<span class="replace" id="tn_13" title="In the printed book: San Ramon">San Ramón</span>,
that squint-eye
who is always abusing other organists, and who
looks more like a butcher from the Puerta de la
Carne than like a musician, is going to play this
Christmas Eve on Maese Pérez's organ. You
know, of course,&mdash;for everybody knows it in
Seville,&mdash;that no musician would accept the
undertaking. Not even his daughter, who is a
professor of music. After her father's death she
entered the convent as a novice. Her refusal
was natural enough. Accustomed as we were to
hearing such marvels, anything else would seem
poor, no matter how desirous we might be to
avoid comparisons; and so the sisterhood had
determined that in honor of the dead musician,
and in token of respect to his memory, the organ
should remain dumb to-night, when here comes
our man, and declares that he is willing to
play it.</p>

<p>"There is nothing so bold as ignorance. To<span
class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
be sure, the fault is not his, but theirs, who permit
such a profanation. But that is the way of
the world&mdash;but, I say, it is no small crowd that has
flocked here to-night. One might think that nothing
had changed from last year to this,&mdash;the same
fine people, the same splendor, the same crush
at the door, the same excitement under the portico,
the same throng in the temple. Ah, if the
dead man were to rise, he would die a second
death rather than witness the profanation of his
organ. But the best of it is that if what the
neighbors have told me is true, the intruder is
going to meet with a fine reception. When the
time comes for him to lay his hands on the keys,
there are those who mean to make a hubbub
with tambourines, timbrels, and drums. But
hold! there is the hero of the occasion going
into the church now. Holy saints! How gaudily
he has arrayed himself What a ruff, and
what grand airs he assumes! Come, come! the
archbishop arrived some time ago, and Mass will
soon begin. Come! for I fancy this night will
give us food for talk."</p>

<p>And saying this, the good woman penetrated
into the church, opening a way for herself
through the crowd, according to her habit, by
dint of pushing and elbowing.</p>

<p>The ceremony had already begun.</p>

<p>The temple was as brilliant as it had been the<span
class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
year before. The new organist pushed through
the crowd that filled the naves, went up to kiss
the bishop's ring, then made his way to the
organ-loft, where he took his seat, and began to
try the stops of the organ one after another with
much affectation of gravity. From the compact
mass of people in the rear of the church rose a
muffled, confused sound,&mdash;a sure augury that
the storm was brewing and would not be long
in making itself felt.</p>

<p>"He is an impostor who cannot do anything
straight, not even look straight," said some.</p>

<p>"He is an ignorant lout, who has turned the
organ of his own parish into a rattle, and comes
here now to profane Maese Pérez's," said others.
And while one relieved himself of his cloak the
better to thump his tambourine, and another
took hold of his timbrels, and all made ready to
greet the first notes of music with a deafening
clamor, there were but very few who ventured
mildly to defend the strange man, whose proud
and pedantic bearing was so strongly in contrast
with the modest appearance and affable kindness
of the former organist.</p>

<p>The longed-for moment came at last,&mdash;the
solemn moment when the priest, after bowing
his brow and murmuring the sacred words, took
the wafer between his fingers. The little bells
rang at the foot of the altar, shaking out a shower<span
class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
of crystal notes. The diaphanous waves of incense
rose in the air and the organ burst into
sound.</p>

<p>A terrible uproar filled the church and drowned
its first chords. Horns, bagpipes, timbrels, tambourines,&mdash;all
the instruments of the populace
lifted their discordant voices at once. But the
clamor only lasted a minute. It all stopped
simultaneously, just as it had begun. The second
chord, full, bold, magnificent, sustained itself.
A torrent of sonorous harmony gushed
from the metal pipes of the organ.</p>

<p>There were celestial chants like those which
caress the ear in moments of ecstasy; chants
which the soul perceives, but which the lip cannot
repeat; single notes of a distant melody
sounding at intervals, brought by a gust of wind;
the sound of leaves that kiss each other on the
limbs of trees with a murmur like rain; trills of
the lark, that rises singing from the flower-covered
land, like an arrow shot into the clouds;
terrible bursts of sound, imposing like the roaring
of a tempest; choruses of seraphim, without
cadence or rhythm, unknown music of another
world, which only the imagination can comprehend;
winged canticles that seemed to rise to the
throne of the Almighty in a whirl of light and
sound,&mdash;all these things were expressed by the
thousand voices of the organ, with a power and<span
class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
poetry more intense, more mystic than had ever
been heard before.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When the organist came down, such was the
crowd that pushed toward the stairway, and such
was the desire to see and admire him, that the
officer of justice, fearing and not without reason
that he would be smothered, sent his beadles, in
order that, stick in hand, they might open a way
for him to the high altar, where the bishop
awaited him.</p>

<p>"You see," said the prelate, when the musician
was introduced into his presence, "I came
all the way from my palace to hear you. Will
you be as cruel as Maese Pérez, who would
never once spare me the journey by consenting
to play on Christmas Eve for midnight Mass at
the Cathedral?"</p>

<p>"Next year," answered the organist, "I will
give you that pleasure, for I would not touch
this organ again for all the gold in the world."</p>

<p>"Why not?" interrupted the prelate.</p>

<p>"Because," said the organist, trying to control
the emotion which was revealed by the pallor
of his countenance,&mdash;"because it is old and
poor, and with such an instrument one cannot
express all that one would like."</p>

<p>The archbishop retired, followed by his attendants.
One by one the litters of the noblemen<span
class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
disappeared in the curves of the neighboring
streets. The crowd around the portico was dissolved;
and the faithful dispersed, taking their
various directions. The church was about to be
locked when two women, who had lingered to
murmur a prayer before the altar of San Felipe,
crossed themselves and went their way, turning
into the Alley of the Dueñas.</p>

<p>"You may say what you choose, my dear Doña
Baltasara," said one of them, "but that is my
opinion. Every madman with his whim. I
would not believe it if I heard it from the lips of
a barefooted Capuchin. It is not possible for
this man to have played what we have just
heard. I tell you, I heard him a thousand times
at San Bartolomé, which was his parish, and
from which he was turned out by the priest because
his music was so poor; my dear, it made
you feel like stopping your ears up with cotton.
And then you have only to look at his face.
The face, they say, is the mirror of the soul.
Think of Maese Pérez. Poor dear man! On a
night like this, when he came down from the
organ-loft after having held the congregation
spell-bound, what a kind smile he wore! What
a happy flush on his countenance! He was old,
and yet he looked like an angel! As for this
fellow, he came stumbling down the stairs as
though a dog were barking at him from the land<span
class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>ing,
and with a face as pale as that of a corpse.
Believe me, my dear, in all truth, there is some
mystery here."</p>


<h3>IV.</h3>

<p>A year had elapsed. The abbess of the convent
of Santa Inés and the daughter of Maese
Pérez were speaking in a whisper, only half visible
in the shadows of the choir. The bells with
loud voices were calling to the faithful from the
height of the steeple. Every now and then one
or two persons crossed the now silent and deserted
portico; and after taking holy water, they
chose their place in the corner of the nave,
where a few neighbors were quietly waiting for
midnight Mass to begin.</p>

<p>"Do you see," the abbess was saying, "your
fears are supremely childish. There is scarcely
a soul in the church. You should have more
self-confidence. All Seville is at the cathedral
to-night. Play for us, my child,&mdash;it is just as
though we were alone. Why do you sigh? What
is the matter with you? Speak."</p>

<p>"I am afraid!" exclaimed the girl, in a
shaken voice.</p>

<p>"Afraid? Why, what do you mean? Afraid
of what?"</p>

<p>"I do not know,&mdash;of something supernatural.
Last night&mdash;listen. I had heard you say that<span
class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
you were anxious to have me play for midnight
Mass this Christmas Eve; and, proud of the distinction,
I thought I would first try the registers
and practise a little, that I might surprise you
and do you honor to-day. I came to the choir
alone; I opened the door which leads to the
organ-loft. The cathedral clock just then was
striking the hour; I do not know what hour,
but the strokes were many, many, and so sad!
The bells went on ringing during all the time
that I stood petrified on the threshold. It
seemed an age to me! The church was empty
and dark. Far away, yonder, a little light glimmered
like a star, lost in the night of the sky. It
was the dying light of the lamp which burns before
the high altar. By its faint reflection, which
only added to the profound horror of the darkness,
I saw,&mdash;yes, I saw it, Mother; do not
doubt me,&mdash;I saw a man, who, sitting with his
back to where I stood, was running one hand
along the keys of the organ, while he touched the
stops with the other, and the organ sounded,
but in a most indescribable manner. Every
note was like a sob stifled within the metal pipes,
which vibrated, reproducing the tone, muffled, almost
imperceptible, but with wonderful accuracy.</p>

<p>"The cathedral clock was still striking the
hour, and the man was still trying the keys. I
could even hear his breathing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span></p>

<p>"The blood in my veins was frozen with horror.
I felt a chill run through my body; my head
was hot; I tried to scream, but I could not, for
the man sitting there had turned his face and
was looking at me. No; I do not mean that;
he was not looking, for he was blind. It was
my father!"</p>

<p>"Come, come, sister, you must try and banish
these foolish fancies with which the arch-enemy
tries to disturb our weak imaginations. Say a
<i>Pater-noster</i> and an <i>Ave-Maria</i> to the archangel
Saint Michael, captain of the celestial hosts, that
he may succor you from evil spirits. Wear on
your neck a scapular touched by the relics of
San Pacomio, the counsellor against temptations;
and go, my child, go and take your place at the
organ. Mass is about to begin, and the faithful
are waiting with impatience. Your father is in
heaven; and it is far more likely that from the
home of the blessed he will inspire you on this
holy night rather than appear to you to give you
a fright."</p>

<p>The abbess went to take her seat in the choir
in the midst of the sisterhood. The daughter of
Maese Pérez opened the door of the organ-loft
with trembling hand, and sat on the stool before
the organ. Mass began.</p>

<p>Mass began, and nothing unusual occurred
until the time of the consecration. At that<span
class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
moment the organ sounded, and with the first
sound came a shriek from the organ-loft.</p>

<p>The abbess, the nuns, and some of the faithful
ran to the organ.</p>

<p>"Look at him! look at him!" cried the girl,
whose eyes, starting from their sockets, were fixed
upon the stool from which she had just risen in
terror. She stood clinging with convulsed
hands to the railing of the loft.</p>

<p>All eyes were turned upon the point which she
indicated. There was no one at the organ, and
still it went on sounding, like the voices of
archangels, in a burst of mystic joy.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"Did I not tell you so, one and a thousand
times, my good Doña Baltasara,&mdash;did I not tell
you so? There is some mystery in all this. Listen.
What! Did you not attend Mass last night?
Anyway, I presume you know what occurred.
Why, it is the talk of Seville to-day. The archbishop
is furious, and with good reason. Think
of his having missed the Mass at Santa Inés,&mdash;of
his not having witnessed the miracle; and all
for what, pray? That he might sit and listen to
a perfect charivari; for according to those who
were present and who told me of it, the new
organist's playing was nothing else. But I said
so all the time. That squint-eye never could
have played the music we heard together last<span
class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
Christmas Eve at Santa Inés. It was a lie!
That music came from another soul. There is a
mystery in all this, my dear,&mdash;a mystery, believe
me."</p>

<p>Yes, and so there was. A deep mystery, a
beautiful mystery, which was the soul of Maese
Pérez.</p>

<h3>I.</h3>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">High</span>
in the steeple the
bells were conversing.
Two of the younger ones
were vexed and spoke
angrily, "Is it not time
we were asleep? It is
almost midnight, and
twice have we been shaken, twice have we been
forced to cry out through the gloom just as
though it were day, and we were singing the call
for Sunday Mass. There are people moving
about in the church; are we going to be tormented
again, I wonder? Might they not leave
us in peace?"</p>

<p>At this the oldest bell in the steeple said
indignantly, in a voice which though cracked
had lost none of its solemnity, "Hush, little
ones! Are you not ashamed to speak so foolishly?
When you went to Rome to be blessed,<span
class="pagenum"><a id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
did you not take an oath, did you not swear to
fulfil your duty? Do you not know that in a
few minutes it will be Christmas, and that you
will then celebrate the birth of Him whose
resurrection you have already celebrated?"</p>

<p>"But it is so cold!" whimpered a young
bell.</p>

<p>"And do you not think that He was cold,
when He came into the world, naked and weak?
Would He not have suffered on the heights of
Bethlehem had not the ass and the ox warmed
Him with their breath? Instead of grumbling
and complaining, let your voices be sweet and
tender in memory of the canticles with which
His mother lulled Him to sleep. Come, hold
yourselves in readiness. I can see them lighting
the tapers; they have constructed a little
manger before the Virgin's altar; the banner is
unfurled; the beadle is bustling about. He has
a bad cold, the poor man; how he sneezes!
Monsieur le Curé has put on his embroidered
alb. I hear the approaching sound of wooden
shoes; the peasants are coming to pray. The
clock is about to strike the hour&mdash;now&mdash;Christmas!
Christmas! Ring out with all your
heart and all your might! Let no man say that
he has not been summoned to midnight Mass."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span></p>


<h3>II.</h3>

<p>It had been snowing for three days. The sky
was black, the ground white; the north wind
howled through the trees; the ponds were frozen;
and the little birds were hungry. Women,
wrapped in long mantles of brown wool, and
men in heavy cloaks slowly made their way into
the church. They knelt and with bent brows
murmured the answer as the priest said, "And
the Lord said unto me, 'Thou art my Son, whom
this day I have begotten.'" The incense was
smoking, and blossoms of hellebore, which are
the roses of Christmas, lay before the tabernacle in
the light of the tapers. Behind one of the pillars,
near the door of the church, knelt a child. His
feet were bare. He had slipped off his wooden
shoes on account of the noise they made. His
cap lay on the floor before him and with clasped
hands he prayed, "For the soul of my father
who is dead, for the life of my mother, and for
me, for your little Jacques, who loves you, O my
God, I implore you!" And he knelt all through
Mass, lost in the fervor of his devotion, and rose
only when he heard the words,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ite missa est."</p>

<p>The people crowded together under the exterior
porch. Every man lighted his lantern,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
and pulled up the collar of his cloak; and the
women drew their mantles closely around them.
Brrr! how cold it was! A little boy called
out to Jacques, "Are you coming with us?"</p>

<p>"No," said he, "I have not time;" and he
started off on a run. He could hear the village
people far away singing the favorite carol of
olden France as they walked home,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry">
  <p>"He is born, the Heavenly Child.</p>
  <p>Ring out, hautbois! ring out, bagpipes!</p>
  <p>He is born, the Heavenly Child;</p>
  <p>Let all voices sing his advent!"</p>
</div>


<h3>III.</h3>

<p>Jacques reached the thatched cottage at the
far end of the hamlet, nestling in a rocky hollow
at the foot of the hill. He opened the door
carefully, and tiptoed into a room in which there
was neither light nor fire.</p>

<p>"Is that you, little one?"</p>

<p>"Yes, mother."</p>

<p>"I prayed while you were praying. You
must be half asleep; go to bed, child. I do
not need anything. If I am thirsty, I have
the water-jug here where I can reach it."</p>

<p>In a corner of the room near Marguerite's
bed, Jacques turned over a litter of ferns and
dry grasses, stretched himself upon it, drew the<span
class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
ragged end of a blanket over him, and fell asleep.
Marguerite, however, did not sleep. She was
thinking, and her thoughts wrung tears from her
eyes. She was evoking the happy days when
her husband was with her, and life seemed so
full of hope. She lay still, so as not to waken
her boy, her head thrown back on the bolster,
the tears trickling off her bony cheeks, her hand
pressed to her hot chest.</p>

<p>Marguerite's husband had been the pride of
his village, a hard worker and an upright man.
At the call of the Conscription he went to the
wagon train, for he was a good driver, kind to
his horses, a man who made his own bed only
after having prepared their litter. He spoke with
pleasure of the time when he had been "in the
army of the war," and would say laughingly, "I
carted heaps of glory in the Crimea and in Italy."
His return to the village was a source of rejoicing.
He had known Marguerite as a child; he
now found her a woman, and married her. They
were poor, Marguerite's trousseau consisting of
a three-franc cap, which she bought in order to
make a good appearance at the church ceremony.
They owned the cottage,&mdash;a miserable,
dilapidated hut; but they were happy in it because
they worked hard and loved each other.
The village people said, "Marguerite is no
simpleton. She knew what she was about when<span
class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
she married Grand-Pierre. The sun does not
find him abed. He is strong, saving too, and
no drunkard."</p>

<p>Yes, Grand-Pierre was a good workman, spry,
punctual,&mdash;a man of much action and few words.
He had resumed his old trade, and drove his
teams through the mountains for a man who
was quarrying granite. He drove four stout-haunched,
wide-chested horses, and excelled in
man&oelig;uvring the screw-jack, in balancing the
heaviest blocks, and driving down the steep declivities
that opened into the plain. When he
came home after his day's work, he found the
soup and a jug of cider on the table, and Marguerite
waiting for him. Everything smiled
upon them in the poor little home, where there
was soon a willow cradle.</p>

<p>But happiness is short-lived. There is an
Arab proverb that says, "As soon as a man
paints his house in pink, fate hastens to daub it
black." For eleven years Pierre and Marguerite
lived happily together and laid their plans with
no fear of the future. Then misfortune came
and made its home with them. One raw, foggy
winter's day Grand-Pierre went out to the mountain.
He loaded his wagon; and after having left
the dangerous passes of the road behind, he sat
on the shaft for a rest, and leaned against a great
block of granite. He was tired; and lulled by<span
class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
the swaying of the vehicle and the monotonous
jingle of the bells, he involuntarily closed his
eyes. After a little the left wheel went over a
great limb that lay across the road. The shock
was violent. Pierre was pitched from his seat;
and before he could move, the heavy wheels
rolled slowly over him and crushed in his
chest.</p>

<p>The horses went their way unconscious of the
fact that their driver, their oldest friend, lay
dead behind them. They reached the quarriers
and stopped at the door.</p>

<p>"Where is Grand-Pierre?"</p>

<p>Inquiries were made at once. Men were sent
to the cottage. Marguerite grew anxious. As
the light failed, they took torches and went up
the mountain, shouting, "Hello there, Grand-Pierre!"
but no voice answered. At last they
came upon the poor man lying in the middle of
the road on his back with outstretched arms.
The wheels had cut through the cloak and the
edge of the rent was crushed into his chest and
black with blood.</p>

<p>All the villagers followed the corpse to the
church and the cemetery, and held out their
hands to Marguerite, who stood white and immobile,
like a statue of wax, muttering mechanically
under her breath, "O God, have pity!
have pity!" Jacques was then in his tenth year.<span
class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
He could not appreciate the greatness of his
mother's sorrow, and only cried because she
did.</p>

<p>Then misfortune had followed misfortune,&mdash;poverty,
illness, misery. And so through this
Christmas night Marguerite lay stifling her sobs
as she recalled the past.</p>


<h3>IV.</h3>

<p>Jacques rose at dawn, shook off the dry
grasses that stuck to his hair, and went over to
his mother. Her eyes were half closed, her lips
very white, and there were warm red spots on
her cheeks. When she saw the boy, she made
a faint movement with her head.</p>

<p>"Did you sleep, mother? Do you feel well?"</p>

<p>"Yes; but I am very cold. Make a little fire,
will you?"</p>

<p>Jacques searched every corner of the hut,
looked in the old cupboard, went through the
cellar which had formerly contained their supplies,
and said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"There is no wood left; and there are no
roots either."</p>

<p>"Never mind, then. It is not so very cold,
after all."</p>

<p>Jacques picked up a stone, hammered at the
nail that secured the strap of his wooden shoe,<span
class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
slipped his foot into it, pulled his cap down
over his ears, and said resolutely,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I am going out to the mountain to get some
dead wood."</p>

<p>"Why, you forget that to-day is Christmas,
my child!"</p>

<p>"I know; but Monsieur le Curé will forgive
me."</p>

<p>"No, no, you must not go; it has been
prohibited."</p>

<p>"I will see that the rural guard does not
catch me. Please let me go; I will be back
soon."</p>

<p>"Well, go, then."</p>

<p>Jacques put his pruning-knife in his pocket,
threw a rope over his shoulder, and opened the
door. A gust of wind thick with snow dashed
him back and whirled through the room.</p>

<p>"What a storm!"</p>

<p>"Holy angels!" cried Marguerite; "it is the
white deluge! Listen, little one: you are not
warm enough. Open the old chest where your
father's things are, and get his cloak,&mdash;the cloak
he had on when they brought him home. Wrap
it around you, and see that you do not take
cold. One sick person in the house is enough."</p>

<p>Jacques took the cloak, upon which a twig of
blessed box had been laid. It was one of those
great black and white cloaks of thick wool and<span
class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
goat-hair, with a small velvet collar and brass
clasps. There was a gaping black rent in it,
and here and there an ugly dark spot. It was
very long for Jacques, so Marguerite pinned the
edges up under the collar. When he was halfway
out of the door she called out to him,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Jacques, if you pass the Trèves do not forget
to say a prayer."</p>


<h3>V.</h3>

<p>Jacques started off at a brisk pace. There
was not a human being to be seen anywhere.
The fields were gloomy and desolate. The
snow seemed to shoot along horizontally, so
violently was it lashed by the north wind. On
the high, frosted limb of a poplar a raven was
croaking. Jacques stopped every now and again
to knock off the snow which gathered and hardened
on the soles of his wooden shoes. He
was not cold, but he found his cloak very heavy.
He had gone a long way and had reached the
first undulations of the mountain, the edge of the
forest, when he stopped petrified before the rural
guard, who appeared suddenly at a turn in the
road, imposing with his cocked hat, his sword,
and the word "Law" glittering on his belt.</p>

<p>This Father Monhache, who had been a sapper
before he became a rural guard, was greatly<span
class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
dreaded in the land. He was the terror of the
village boys, for whenever he found any of them
stealing apples, shaking the plum-trees, or knocking
down nuts, he swore at them terribly, and
then led them by the ear to Monsieur le Maire,
who sentenced the delinquents to a paternal
spanking. Jacques was therefore aghast when
he found himself face to face with this merciless
representative of the authority.</p>

<p>"Where are you going, Jacques, in this devil
of a storm?"</p>

<p>Jacques tried to concoct some story to explain
his expedition; and before he had decided
which would be the most effective, he caught
himself saying simply,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I am going to the mountain, Father Monhache,
to get some dead wood. We have none
at home, and my mother is ill."</p>

<p>The old guard dropped an oath and said in a
voice which was by no means harsh,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ah, so you are going to the mountain for
dead wood, are you? Well, if I meet you in the
village this evening with your fagot, I will close
one eye and wink the other, do you understand?
And if you ever tell anybody what I said, I will
pull your ears." And he walked off with a shrug.
He had not gone ten feet when he turned and
shouted, "There is more dead wood in the
copse of the Prévoté than anywhere else."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span></p>


<h3>VI.</h3>

<p>"He is not such a bad man, after all,"
thought Jacques.</p>

<p>He was now climbing the mountain, and it
was a hard struggle for his little legs. Every
now and then he heard what he thought was a
moan in the distance,&mdash;the breaking of a limb
under the weight of the snow. Look as he
would through all those branches, he could not
see a single blackbird, nor even a jay. Not a
little mouse ran along the slope. A few intrepid
sparrows alone, black spots on the white ground,
hopped about in search of food.</p>

<p>Measuring his steps to the time, Jacques began
to sing in a low tone,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry">
  <p>"He is born, the Heavenly Child,&mdash;"</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">and walked along with a great effort, leaning
forward. He sunk into hollows where the snow
was deep. He knew that he was not far from
the copse of the Prévoté, so he took courage,
though he stubbed his foot against the hard,
concealed ruts, and tumbled into holes. Father
Monhache was right; there was surely no lack of
dead wood at the copse of the Prévoté.</p>

<p>Over the shivering heather and the crouching
brier, lay the fallen branches in their furrows.<span
class="pagenum"><a id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
Jacques fell to work; and how he toiled! He
had taken off his cloak, that his movements
might be freer. His legs sunk deep in the snow.
His hands and his arms were drenched and
chilled, while his face was hot and wet with perspiration.
He would stop every minute or two
to look at his pile of wood, and think of the
bright flame it would make in the hut.</p>

<p>When he had all he could carry, he tied it in
a fagot, threw his cloak over his shoulders, and
started along the shortest cut to the village. His
legs trembled. Now and then he was compelled
to stop and lean against a tree.</p>


<h3>VII.</h3>

<p>After a little he came to a cross-road. This
was Trèves. In the days of the Romans it had
been called Trivium, because of the three roads
that met there. On that spot had formerly stood
an altar to Mercury, the protector of roads, the
god of travellers, and the patron of thieves.
Christianity had torn down the Pagan altar and
replaced it by a crucifix of granite. On the
pedestal, gnawed by lichens, one may still find
the date, <small>A. D.</small> 1314. During the Hundred
Years' War the statue was shattered, and the
cross-road strewn with its fragments. Then,
when the foreign element which sullied our land<span
class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
had been cast out, when "Joan, the good maid
of Lorraine," had returned the kingdom of
France to the little king of Bourges, the statue
was raised, and from that time it has been the
object of special veneration through the country.
Every peasant bows before it, and even the veterinary,
who delights in laughing at priests, would
not dare pass the Trèves without raising his hat.</p>

<p>With his hands nailed to the cross, his brow
encircled with thorns, the Christ hangs, as
though he were calling the whole world to take
refuge in his outstretched arms. He seems
enormous. In the folds of the cloth which
girds his loins wrens have built nests that have
never been disturbed. His face is turned
toward the East; and his hollow, suffering gaze
is fixed upon the sky, as though he were looking
for the star that guided the Magi and led the
shepherds to the stable in Bethlehem.</p>


<h3>VIII.</h3>

<p>Jacques did not forget his mother's instruction.
He laid down his fagot, took off his cap,
and there, on his knees, began a prayer, to
which the wind moaned a dreary accompaniment.
He repeated some prayers which he had
learned at the Catechism class; he said others
too,&mdash;fervent words that rose of themselves<span
class="pagenum"><a id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
from his heart. And as he prayed, he looked
up at the Christ, lashed by the storm. Its parted
lips and upturned eyes gave it an expression of
infinite pain. Two little icicles, like congealed
tears, hung on its eyelids, and the emaciated
body stretched itself upon the cross in a last
spasm of agony. Jacques began to suffer with
the suffering embodied there, and he was moved
to console the One whom he had come to
invoke.</p>

<p>When his prayers were said, he took up his
fagot and started on his way; but before he
had left the cross-road behind him, he turned
and looked back. The Christ's eyes seemed to
follow him. The face was less sombre; the
features seemed to have relaxed into an expression
of infinite gentleness. A gust of wind
shook the snow that had accumulated on its
outstretched arms. One might have believed
that the statue had shivered. Jacques stopped.
"Oh, my poor God," said he, "how cold you
are!" and he went back and stood before the
crucifix. Then with a sudden impulse he took
off his cloak. He climbed upon the pedestal,
then putting his foot upon the projection of the
loin-cloth, and reaching about the shoulders, he
threw the cloak around the statue.</p>

<p>When he had reached the ground again,
"Now, at least, you will not be so cold!"<span
class="pagenum"><a id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
said he; and the two little icicles that had hung
on the eyelids of the divine image melted and
ran slowly down the granite cheeks like tears of
gratitude.</p>

<p>Jacques started off at a rapid pace. The
cruel north wind blew through his cotton blouse.
He began to run, and the fagot beat against his
shoulders and bruised them. At last he reached
the foot of a declivity and stopped panting by a
ravine sheltered from the snow and the wind by
a wall of pines. How tired he was! He descended
into the ravine and sat down to rest,
only for a minute, thought he,&mdash;just a minute
more, and he would be up again and on his way
to his mother. How tired he was! His head,
too, was very hot, and felt heavy. He lay down
and leaned his head against the fagot. "I
must not go to sleep," he said. "Oh, no, I will
not go to sleep;" and as he said this, his eyelids
drooped, and he became suddenly engulfed in a
great flood of unconsciousness.</p>


<h3>IX.</h3>

<p>When Jacques awoke he was greatly surprised.
The ravine, the snow, the forest, the mountain,
the gray sky, the freezing wind,&mdash;all had disappeared.
He looked for his fagot, but could
find it nowhere. He had never seen or even<span
class="pagenum"><a id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
heard of this new country; and he was unable to
define its substance, to circumscribe its immensity,
or appreciate its splendors. The air was
balmy, saturated with exquisite perfumes, and
it exhaled soft harmonies that made his heart
quiver with delight.</p>

<p>He rose. The ground beneath his feet was
elastic, and seemed to rise to meet his step,
so that walking became restful. A luminous
halo hovered about him. Instead of the old
torn cloak, he wore a mantle strewn with stars,
and it was seamless, like the one for which dice
were cast on the heights of Calvary. His hands&mdash;his
poor little hands, tumefied with chilblains,
and which the cold had chapped and creviced,&mdash;were
now white and soft like the tips of a
swan's wings. Jacques was amazed, but no feeling
of fear agitated him. He was calm and felt
strangely confident. A great burden seemed to
have been lifted from his shoulders; he was as
light as the air, and aglow with beatitude.</p>

<p>"Where am I?" he asked; and a voice more
harmonious than the whispering of the breeze
answered,&mdash;</p>

<p>"In my Father's House, which is the home of
the Just."</p>

<p>Then through a veil of azure and light a great
granite crucifix arose before him. It was the
crucifix of the Trèves. Grand-Pierre's cloak,<span
class="pagenum"><a id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
with the rent across it, floated from the shoulders
of the Christ. The coarse wool had grown
as diaphanous as a cloud, and through it the
light radiated as from a sun. The thorns on his
brow glittered like carbuncles, and a superhuman
beauty lighted his countenance. From fields of
space which the sight could now explore came
aerial chants. Jacques fell upon his knees and
prostrated himself.</p>

<p>The Christ said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Rise, little one; you were moved to pity by
the sufferings of your God,&mdash;you stripped yourself
of your cloak to shield him from the cold,
and this is why he has given you his cloak in
exchange for yours; for of all the virtues the
highest and rarest is charity, which surpasses
wisdom and knowledge. Hereafter you will be
the host of your God."</p>

<p>Jacques took a few steps toward the dazzling
vision and held out his arms in supplication.</p>

<p>"What do you want?" said the Christ.</p>

<p>The child said, "I want my mother."</p>

<p>"The angels who carried Mary into Egypt
will bring her to you."</p>

<p>There was a great rustle of wings, and a smile
shone on the face of the granite Christ.</p>

<p>Jacques was praying, but his prayer was unlike
any that he had ever said before. It was a
chant of ecstasy, which rose to his lips in words<span
class="pagenum"><a id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
so beautiful that he experienced a sense of ineffable
happiness in listening to himself.</p>

<p>Far away, on the brink of the horizon, pure
and clear as crystal, he saw Marguerite borne
toward him on billows of white. She was no
longer pale, worn, and sad. She was radiant,
and glowed with that internal light which is the
beauty of the soul, and is alone imperishable.
The angels laid her at the foot of the crucifix,
and she prostrated herself and adored. When
she raised her head there were two souls beside
her, and their essences blended in one kiss, in
one burst of gratitude. The granite Christ
wept.</p>


<h3>X.</h3>

<p>High in the steeple the bells are conversing.
The two younger ones are sullen. "The people
in this village are mad. Why can they never be
quiet? Were not yesterday's duties sufficiently
tiresome?&mdash;midnight Mass, Matins, the Mass of
the Aurora, the third Mass, High Mass, Vespers,
the Angelus, to say nothing of supplementary
chimes. There was no end to it! And now
to-day we must begin all over again. They
pull us, they shake us,&mdash;first the toll for the
dead, the funeral service next, then the burial.
It is really too much! Why will they never
leave us in peace on our frames? Our clappers<span
class="pagenum"><a id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
are weary, and our sides are bruised with the
repeated strokes. What can be the matter with
these peasants? Here they come to church
again in their holiday clothes. Father Monhache
wears his most forbidding scowl; his beard
bristles fiercely; every now and then he brushes
something from his eyes with the back of his
hand. His cocked hat has a defiant tilt. The
boys had better be on their guard this day. Far
down the road there, I see two coffins, one large
and one small. They are lifting them on the oxcart;
see! But what is that to us, and why are
we expected to ring?"</p>

<p>The old bell, full of wisdom and experience,
reproved them, saying,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Be still, and do not shame me with your
ignorance. You have no conception of the dignity
of your functions. You have been blessed;
you are church-bells. To men you say, 'Keep
vigil over your immortal souls!' and to God, 'O
Father, have pity on human weakness!' Instead
of being proud of your exalted mission,
and meditating upon what you see, you chatter
like hand-bells and reason like sleigh-bells.
Your bright color and your clear voices need
not make you vain, for age will tarnish you and
the fatigues of your duty will crack your voices.
When years have passed; when you shall have
proclaimed church festivals, weddings, births,<span
class="pagenum"><a id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
christenings, and funerals; after having raised
the alarms for conflagrations, and rung the tocsin
at the invasion of the enemy,&mdash;you will no
longer complain of your fate; you will begin to
comprehend the things of this world, and divine
the secrets of the other; you will come to understand
how tears on earth can become smiles in
heaven.</p>

<p>"So ring gently, gently, without sadness or
fear. Let your voices sound like the cooing of
doves. A torn cloak in this world may be a
mantle of eternal blessedness in the next."</p>

so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free

(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
